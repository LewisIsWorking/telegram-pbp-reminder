# PBP Reminder Bot

A free, serverless bot for **play-by-post tabletop RPG groups on Telegram**.
Runs hourly via GitHub Actions, tracks activity across campaigns, and posts
summaries, nudges, and awards directly into your group topics.

No hosting, no server, no cost. Just a GitHub repo, a Telegram bot, and a config file.

Choose your boon:
1. A stray cat follows you and hisses at anyone who lies to you.
2. You find a coin in your boot that wasn't there before.
3. The next innkeeper insists your money is no good here.
4. +1 circumstance bonus on your next skill check.
```

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions (hourly cron)
    |
    v
checker.py  -->  Telegram Bot API (fetch messages, send alerts)
    |
    v
GitHub Gist (persisted state between runs)
```

The bot expects a Telegram supergroup with **forum topics** enabled.
Each campaign needs two topics: a **PBP topic** (where the game happens)
and a **Chat topic** (where the bot posts summaries and alerts).

Posts within 10 minutes of each other are treated as a single "posting session"
so rapid back-and-forth doesn't inflate counts.

Campaigns can have multiple PBP topics (e.g. if you split scenes across threads).
The bot merges them under one canonical ID for all tracking.

---

## Setup

Takes about 15 minutes.

### 1. Create a Telegram bot

1. Message **@BotFather** on Telegram.
2. Send `/newbot`, follow the prompts, copy the **bot token**.
3. Send `/setprivacy`, select your bot, set to **Disable**
   (so it can read all messages, not just `/commands`).
4. Add the bot to your supergroup.
5. Make it an **admin** (needs: Read Messages, Send Messages).

### 2. Find your topic IDs

Open this URL in a browser (replace `YOUR_TOKEN`):
```
https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates
```

Send one message in each PBP topic and each Chat topic, then refresh.
You'll see JSON like:
```json
{
  "message": {
    "chat": { "id": -1001234567890 },
    "message_thread_id": 12345
  }
}
```

Note down:
- `chat.id` is your **group_id** (same for all topics).
- `message_thread_id` is the **topic ID** (unique per topic).
- Your Telegram **user ID** (visible in the `from.id` field). This is your GM ID.

### 3. Create a GitHub Gist

1. Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com).
2. Create a gist with filename `pbp_state.json` and content `{}`.
3. Save it. Copy the **Gist ID** from the URL.

### 4. Create a GitHub token

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Generate a classic token with the **gist** scope only.
3. Copy the token.

### 5. Fork or create the repo

1. Fork this repo (or create a new one and copy the files).
2. Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from BotFather |
| `GIST_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT with gist scope |
| `GIST_ID` | Gist ID from step 3 |

### 6. Configure

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill it in:

```json
{
    "group_id": -1001234567890,
    "alert_after_hours": 4,
    "gm_user_ids": [123456789],
    "leaderboard_topic_id": null,
    "topic_pairs": [
        {
            "name": "My Campaign",
            "chat_topic_id": 11111,
            "pbp_topic_ids": [22222],
            "created": "2025-01-15"
        }
    ]
}
```

Key fields:
- **group_id**: Your supergroup's chat ID (negative number).
- **gm_user_ids**: Array of GM Telegram user IDs. GMs are excluded from player stats.
- **leaderboard_topic_id**: Topic ID for the cross-campaign leaderboard (or `null` to disable).
- **topic_pairs**: One entry per campaign. Each needs a name, a chat topic, and one or more PBP topics.
- **created**: Campaign start date for anniversary alerts (optional, `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **disabled_features**: Optional list of features to disable for this campaign.
  Valid values: `alerts`, `warnings`, `roster`, `potw`, `pace`, `recruitment`, `combat`, `anniversary`.

### 7. Add boons (optional)

The Player of the Week feature picks 3 random flavour boons from `boons.json`
plus 1 mechanical boon. Copy `boons.example.json` to `boons.json` and add your own,
or use the example as-is. Each entry is a plain string.

### 8. Test

Go to **Actions > PBP Inactivity Reminder > Run workflow**.
Check the logs. You should see:
```
Loaded state. Offset: 0 | Tracking 0 topics, 0 players
Received N new updates
Done
```

The bot will start tracking from this point. Features like rosters and POTW
will activate once enough data has accumulated.

## Configuration reference

All settings go in the `settings` block of `config.json`.
Every setting has a sensible default, so the entire block is optional.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `roster_interval_days` | 3 | Days between party roster posts |
| `potw_interval_days` | 7 | Days between Player of the Week awards |
| `potw_min_posts` | 5 | Minimum posting sessions to qualify for POTW |
| `pace_interval_days` | 7 | Days between pace comparison reports |
| `leaderboard_interval_days` | 3 | Days between cross-campaign leaderboard |
| `combat_ping_hours` | 4 | Hours before pinging players who haven't acted |
| `recruitment_interval_days` | 14 | Days between recruitment notices |
| `required_players` | 6 | Target party size (triggers recruitment notices) |
| `post_session_minutes` | 10 | Posts within this window count as one session |
| `player_warn_weeks` | [1, 2, 3] | Weeks of inactivity before each warning |
| `player_remove_weeks` | 4 | Weeks of inactivity before auto-removal |

Top-level settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `alert_after_hours` | 4 | Hours of topic silence before inactivity alert |

## Commands

The bot responds to these commands in any monitored PBP topic:

**Everyone:**
- `/help` - List bot features and commands.
- `/status` - Campaign health snapshot: party size, last post, posts this week, at-risk players.

**GM only:**
- `/round 1 players` - Start round 1 player phase.
- `/round 1 enemies` - Start round 1 enemy phase.
- `/endcombat` - End combat tracking.

During the player phase, the bot tracks which players have posted.
After `combat_ping_hours` hours, it pings players who haven't acted yet.

---

## Multi-topic campaigns

If a campaign uses multiple PBP threads (e.g. split scenes), list them all:
```json
{
    "name": "My Campaign",
    "chat_topic_id": 11111,
    "pbp_topic_ids": [22222, 33333, 44444]
}
```
The first ID becomes the canonical ID. All posts across the listed topics
are merged for stats, rosters, POTW, and leaderboards.

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not seeing messages:**
Privacy mode must be disabled (`/setprivacy` > Disable via @BotFather)
and the bot must be a group admin.

**No updates showing:**
Send a message in a monitored topic after the bot is added, then check logs.

**Wrong topic IDs:**
Topic IDs are the `message_thread_id` field in the Telegram API response,
not the message ID. Each forum topic has a unique thread ID.

**GitHub Actions not running:**
Check the Actions tab for errors. Free tier allows 2,000 minutes/month;
this bot uses roughly 30 minutes/month.

**Features not activating:**
Most features need accumulated data. Rosters need posts with timestamps,
POTW needs a week of data, pace reports need two weeks. Give it time.

---

## Cost

Zero. GitHub Actions free tier gives 2,000 minutes/month.
This bot uses about 30 seconds per run, 720 runs/month = ~36 minutes.
The Gist and Telegram Bot API are also free.

---

## Archive Dashboard

The bot archives weekly stats to `data/weekly_archive.json`.
A built-in dashboard at `docs/index.html` visualizes this data with charts and tables.

To enable it via GitHub Pages:
1. Go to repo **Settings > Pages**.
2. Set source to **Deploy from a branch**, branch `main`, folder `/docs`.
3. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

Or open `docs/index.html` locally (it fetches the JSON via relative path).
