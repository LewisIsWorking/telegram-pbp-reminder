**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 02:56:50):
So the party leave the shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 02:56:55):
And go to another shop...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:02:24):
Alita & ★Super idol Livy★ syndronise their internal navigation.

This pulls from the local infosphere.

This path will involve routing the group through the cramped corridors of Little Akiton.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:02:41):
The holographic sun overhead plays its tinny Sunny-6's jingle.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:02:54):
Someone in the town fires a frustrated laser bolt at it from a rooftop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:03:08):
The false sky flickers as the laser bolt connects...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:05:24):
The arms shop of CASTLE COUNTING...
is wedged between a hydroponic mushroom 🍄 farm and a specialty workshop for working with heavy metal, specifically hull-plate salvaging operations.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:06:04):
A mechanical brass sign hangs above the door, each letter styled as a different clock face:

CASTLE-COUNTING

And below that text:
"Every Moment Matters"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:08:24):
The group steps inside.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:08:50):
This place has a bizarre SOUND to it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:09:50):
There are so many, many time pieces in this shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:10:55):
At least hundreds of watches, clocks (analogue and digital) and chronometers.

They all tick in perfect synchronization.

A cascading wave of mechanical heartbeats.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 03:12:32):
The other sound is GUNS.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-04 13:32:38):
Alita heads over to check out the range

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:14:49):
For those who are walking to the centre of the shop, where the shopkeep is you see more high end pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:14:54):
Galactic standard.

Akitonian sols.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:15:15):
And just off the centre of the shop:

A grandfather clock.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:15:58):
It's old. Real old. 

The wooden grandfather clock is so out of place here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:16:14):
It's labelled "Korvosian Palace"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:16:34):
It shows the date using a variety of clock faces, it takes a moment to read them all...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:17:28):
4710, Rova 10th.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:19:08):
The checkout counter is not manned but a few metres behind it is a workbench. 

And at that workbench is a dwarf.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:19:30):
The workbench is cluttered with disassembled mechanisms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:19:38):
A brass monocle magnifies one eye to unsettling proportions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:19:48):
His right arm ends not in a hand but in a rotating multi-tool assembly.

It is currently configured as delicate tweezers adjusting something inside an open pocket watch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:22:28):
There is something odd about this pocket watch. 

It does not tell the time. 

It is counting down. 

There seems to be counting down roughly 9 years from now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:22:45):
The dwarf, he doesn't look up immediately.
Finishes his adjustment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:22:54):
Sets the watch down with precise care.
Tick. Tick. Tick.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:22:57):
Counting down...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:23:34):
Then the shopkeep smiles warmly, genuinely:
"Ah. 
New faces at just the perfect moment. 
The calibration can wait... customers cannot!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:24:47):
The dwarf rises to his full height, his mechanical arm reconfigures into an open palm of greeting:
"Ophelius Berrus. 
Timekeeper, tinkerer, and..."

@Ravnos1 
As he trails off, his monocled eye sweeps over Chua's gear with professional interest:
"...purveyor of instruments that make moments count."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:25:41):
Ophelius Berrus:
"You're looking for something specific, yes? 

I can see it in your posture. 

The lean of someone who knows exactly what they want but hasn't found the right place to acquire it."

Ophelius Berrus's smile widens:

"Well. 

You've found it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:26:46):
Behind the main counter, a glass display case holds an array of even higher end weapons, the weapons displayed alongside the timepieces.

Sleek rifles. 

Compact pistols. 

A few items that blur the line between chronometer and armament.

One rifle in particular catches the light: 
An Aeon Rifle.

Its barrel etched with temporal measurement markings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-04 14:28:33):
Ophelius Berrus notices Chua and anyone else trained in crafting and/or has an interest in guns:

"Ah. 

You have excellent timing."

Ophelius Berrus chuckles at his own joke: 

"That piece has been waiting... I mean, been in stock for a while.

Practically destined for someone, I'd say."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-04 18:28:30):
Miyu is rather distracted by all the clocks and devices. The shifting color patterns of his fur bounce off the many reflective surfaces, which prompts him to shift positions to see if he can maximize the effect.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-04 20:30:29):
Chua walked in and stopped as all the clocks around him were ticking, he reaches into one of suits pockets and pulls out his touchstone and compares the time on it to the time being displayed.  He feels it tick in his hand as it synchronizes with the other clocks in the shop.  Closing his eyes he stands there meditating on the spaces between the beats of time centering himself.  He returns his touchstone to its pocket and  moves in with the rest.  

When he arrives at the counter he watches the mechanic at work.  "There is no need to rush on my part.  "I know that sometimes pausing a delicate task can set you back hours just to restart.  However, if you feel the time is right to break, I am interested in picking up a rifle.  Several of my allies have recommended that I should have a range weapon.  From what I know of Aeon Rifles it would suit my temperament even if it is more advanced than what I am used to wielding.  Do you have any others in stock beyond that one, or if not how much would it lighten my credstick?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-09 04:58:35):
Chua turns to look over at Miyu and watches hum shift around.  He understands the simple joy of watching how the universe can change.  Where he sees the math of it, Miyu must enjoy the reflections.  "Hey Miyu feel free to dance as much as you like, Perhaps Livy will give you a beat to work from."  he turns back to Ophelius, "Well I  do not have enough in hard cash, but I do have some bits and pieces that might interest you in trade for the balance"  (380 credits is 36 Gold correct)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:24:39):
Chua reaches to his pack but as he does so his hand rests upon the hilt of his knife and he pauses as he listens to the silences between the beats of the shops clocks and the feel of his own pocket watch.  The thing it is was almost the same but not quite in sync with the clocks in the shop.  He concentrates on that infinitesimal variation and realizes that weapon he was looking at may have been suitable for the version of himself that was born before the scream.   However looking at his knife and sensing the vibrations within, he realizes that the items that bond to his warp take on more power than the items of this universe.   He rests his hand more firmly upon his knife.  "I changed my mind, If I was who was born in this universe than that rifle would be perfect for that version of me.  However, I do not need that weapon though crafted very well, it would still be out of sync to me.  You may not hear it but I do and i see the variance in its harmonic fields.  Instead,  I will take the base model, one that has not fully adapted itself to this universe, as its internal equations have not been set.  In addition do you have any 1st circle spell gems?"

Hopeful End times PBP

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-12 19:32:38):
Is there an actual range Alita can practice at?

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-12 19:33:44):
Gonna do that while Chua is shopping.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-12 19:38:04):
Miyu, finally finding an ideal spot that maximizes his natural illumination, begins to focus on his fur, emitting pulses in a rhythm that coincides with how he interprets the ticking of the room's clocks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:09:47):
Ophelius goes very still.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:10:01):
Not the stillness of surprise. 

The stillness of a clockmaker who has just heard a time mechanism correct itsel

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:10:29):
His monocled eye studies Chua for a long moment. 

The clocks tick in the background.

The multi-tool arm cycles to a resting position, all its instruments folding inward like a closed flower.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:10:38):
Ophelius Berrus:
"Most people talk themselves into spending more.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:11:07):
Ophelius Berrus continues:

"You just talked yourself out of it.

And your reasoning is better than theirs."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:12:12):
Ophelius reaches up and lifts the Commercial Aeon Rifle off the wall mount.

Ophelius then Sets the firearm on the counter cloth with practiced care. 

The weapon is lighter than the Tactical model and plainer in its housing.

The crystal slot is unfinished and faintly cloudy, like a lens that hasn't decided what it wants to focus on yet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:13:29):
Ophelius Berrus continues:

"You are correct that this one has not settled.

The gunsmiths tend to calibrate their weapons in factory conditions.

They do these tests in sealed environments, completely sterile fields.

Every tactical model off the line then gets tuned to the specific harmonic frequency of the assembly plant where it was born." 

Ophelius taps the non-tactical rifle and says:
"This one?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:14:34):
Ophelius Berrus looks at the rifle with a wise gaze of concern and interest, as if he'd never seen the rifle before.

Ophelius seems like he is almost listening for something before he continues:
"Still listening."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:15:38):
Ophelius turns a little more serious and says:

"30 credits and it is then yours."

Ophelius pauses, and something flickers behind that magnified eye. 

Not suspicion. 

Something closer to recognition, like a man hearing a phrase in a language he hasn't spoken in a very long time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:16:32):
Ophelius Berrus continues:

"Not many people can hear variance in a harmonic field.

Fewer still would choose the unfinished instrument over the polished one because of it.

You have been changed by something, haven't you?

No need to answer me.

I know what it looks like when the universe has put its hands inside someone and rearranged the intervals.

Tick... Tick... Tick.."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:16:53):
Then the warmth returns, easy and genuine, and he pulls open a drawer beneath the counter, his eyes looking inside to find...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:17:11):
Ophelius Berrus smiles, looks up at the group and says:
"First-circle spell gems.

I keep a modest selection."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:17:38):
He lays out a small velvet tray. Five crystalline capsules sit in moulded slots, each one glowing faintly with an encoded script visible through the silicon casing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:18:14):
Ophelius Berrus continues:
"Forty credits apiece.

Remember laddies that each one is single-use."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:19:04):
Ophelius explains:

"The gem burns out when cast... but if you seat one in that aeon slot before it's spent, then you'll get five bonus battery charges that regenerate each morning.

Not a bad trick for a weapon that only holds ten."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:20:42):
Ophelius looks at the gems.

Then he points at each one in turn one articulated tool-finger.

Ophelius:
"I have Mystic Armor for personal shielding.

Gravitational Pull for repositioning.

Jolting Surge if you want to hit something with lightning and don't mind getting close.

Magic Missile if you prefer your violence reliable and un-dodgeable.

And Phantasmal Minion if you want a little helper that doesn't talk back."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:23:54):
Ophelius grins beneath his beard:
"I have more in the back if you're looking for something else.

For a warper, I would lean toward the Missiles or the Jolting Surge.

I'm normally right about what a customer is looking for.

But I have been wrong about customers before." 

Ophelius seems to zone out...

Ophelius:
"About my sons. 
I was wrong about what they needed...." 

Ophelius shakes his head:
"Haha sorry, the old brain circuits get crossed with the flesh ones sometimes, hahaha."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:24:02):
Ophelius laughs but it sounds a bit... Forced.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:25:01):
Ophelius glances toward the far back of the shop to the gun range.

Ophelius's eyes land on where Alita has been scanning the walls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:25:55):
Ophelius clicks a button on his arm and 3 lanes of hard light test dummies appear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:26:43):
Ophelius:

"Your friend, tell them to shoot to their hearts content, ammo on the house. 

I do not charge for use if you are browsing the merchandise.

Consider it a courtesy of my boss."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:28:08):
Ophelius Berrus taps a button on his arm and his voice comes out through the shops speaker systems:

"Ear protection is on the hook.

Try not to shoot the clock on the far wall." 

Then in his normal voice, to the group he says:
That clock belonged to a Queen...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:33:12):
At the back of the shop...

Miyuu.

Your chromatic pulses have found the rhythm. 

You are not just reflecting now. 

Responding. 

Resonating.

Reflecting and resetting.

Your fur shifts in waves that sync with the nearest cluster of chronometers, each colour change landing precisely on the tick.

The effect is hypnotic to all those in the shop, which is only the party.

Refracted light cascades across the crystal faces in expanding rings.

They are turning the row of Pendulums into a slow, rippling aurora of colour and brass.

Two of the analogue clocks on the west wall begin to tick in audible sync with the pulse.

Then three. 

Then five.

Ophelius watches (get it?).

His monocle swivels.

He watches for exactly four more seconds.

Ophelius Berrus:
"...That is not just reflection." 

Ophelius smiles widely:

"That is beautiful.

This is entertainment.

Your friend is synchronizing my clocks."

A slow exhale through his nose.

Ophelius Berrus continues:

"I calibrate those by hand.

It can take me the better part of a week to get a full row aligned.

He's done five of them in under a minute by dancing."

Ophelius looks back to Chua:
"Where did you find these people? 
Extraordinary."

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-14 18:02:44):
Meanwhile, oblivious to all the mysticism Alita is going  to plink targets, in full auto.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-14 20:03:07):
"My targeting subroutines are off, this will take some time to recalibrate." Alita mumbles to herself as she makes her way back to the group.

She looks at Chua "Have you finished acquiring a weapon? Can we proceed to our objective?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 20:17:49):
When Ophelius says "war" it hangs in the air heavily.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-14 21:31:05):
"I have been prepared for it and I had to fight for my freedom."

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-14 21:39:31):
"You could call it a personal one perhaps?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-14 23:49:33):
To Ophelius,  The universe chose us and shaped us for some purpose.  It screamed in pain and we were evolved a combination of many paths merging.'  He hands over 70 credits for the rifle and a crystal for the minion spell.  He picks up the rifle and checks it heft and dry sights the target finder on it.  Chua opens his warp field and attaches the crystal to the warp field. Everyone will briefly see calculations and math formulae appear over everything within the field.  The Rifle vibrates for a moment as it recalibrates and attunes to Chua matching his personal variables.  The field collapses.  "Alita,  I am almost done."  He turns to Ophelius once more.  "Sir, you mentioned something about your sons, is it something you need freelance help with?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-15 23:20:37):
Faintly in the background, barely audible beneath the ticking of the many clocks the door opens and closes. As he enters he "hears" the same painful, impossible sound that his deaf ears first heard a few days before. The sound that somehow overcame his own disability and wormed its way directly into his brain. The "sound" is lesser than that day, but instead of one source it is coming from most of the people in the shop. Grimacing from the multiple sources he tries to shake it off as his curiosity as to why it is coming from them is greater than his urge to recoil away.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-16 19:34:36):
Rune pauses and does a quick series of hand signs in front of his chest. After a moment a voice comes from his comm unit.

"I am deaf. I can read lips, but am non-verbal. Do you know sign language? If not may I have permission to use my Telepathy Node to speak to you telepathically?"

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-16 20:09:36):
"You have my permission"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-17 03:20:45):
Activating the node within his head the android in front of him soon 'hears' the vlaka.

"First, thank you for letting me talk like this. Now, you asked if I was transposed by that terrible scream. No, I wasn't. I did however hear it and as someone who has been deaf since birth it was debilitating."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-17 03:27:01):
Chua turns to look towards the newcomer in the bar and as his warp field moves to cover them.  He studies the equations that float around the android, then it collapses.  "He two appears to have had two fates combined, so the universe has brought them here as well.  With the data crystal and rifle I have what I need. "

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-17 03:43:12):
Standing near the door to the shop is an exceptionally tall, fairly athletic Vlaka wearing goggles and the signature vest of an AbadarCorp courier with what appears to be a set of microcord armor that seems to have programmable trim as the colors of AbadarCorp are reflected on the armor as well. He has white fur all over what you can see of his body except on top of his head where he has his overly thick fur braided and dyed silvery-grey. At his side he has an Arc Pistol and his messenger bag. If you look a little closer you notice multiple plugs filling the holes where piercings likely would be when he is off-duty.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-17 19:14:27):
"I see. Well met then, Rune" She pauses for a second staring into nowhere "I just stumbled across a map of Dock 3, should have been an encrypted channel but I got lucky with a brute force hack. Chua, Miyu are you ready to proceed with our mission to earn credits?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-18 20:21:16):
Rune looks from her to the other people gathered there with a look of confusion. He considers responding through telepathy but instead uses his comm unit, bringing up a hardlight keyboard and typing furiously. After a short time he finishes and the same computerized voice speaks up.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-18 20:22:53):
"I just met all of you so I don't know if this is normal. I'm not necessarily opposed to this, but it is a little out of the blue. Maybe we can talk a little more about what happened first."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-18 21:04:09):
Miyu finally chimes in, his fur still pulsating various colors to the beat of the clocks. "Well, what do you want to talk about? If you are looking for answers to what you heard, I honestly do not have any. I'm hoping that by following these people who have experienced it as well, maybe we will uncover something."

He then turns towards the door, "Otherwise, we should talk along the way."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-19 03:06:36):
Chua approaches closer "Livy there was here first in this group.  I was merged with them from a separate but similar job.  At the bottom of an impossibly long elevator shaft on Absalom Station.  We all heard the scream and when we did so, we gained more of ourselves then we did not.  Since then we have been moving forward,  Trying to make money because investigating this phenomenon is not going to be cheap. We all have the same questions.  Why now?  Why us? What does it mean?  Are we to stop it or spread it further?  I am not sure what else you want to know.  But ask your questions."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-19 04:55:18):
The vlaka frowns as he thinks about what was just said and the situation. He takes several moments before beginning to type again with several pauses and gestures as he rethinks and rewrites what he wishes to say before he finally finishes and activates the text to speech again.

"For now my main concern is what everyone's experiences were with it and what exactly it did to each of us. But maybe that is a conversation best had somewhere more private. No offense to the very patient shop owner. Also, I don't wish to complicate things but I am actually on break from my job. So I would need to get out of the rest of my shift and gather the rest of my gear in case of trouble if I come along to whatever is going on at Dock 3."

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-19 20:10:29):
The bells above Ophelius's door don't chime.

They *shudder*—a discordant, jarring sound that cuts through the ticking of a thousand clocks like a wound. Every timepiece in the shop seems to stutter, just for a moment, as if reality itself has briefly lost its rhythm.

The door doesn't so much open as *yield*.

Lowda Medina has to duck to enter, which he does with the careful, exhausted movements of someone who has learned exactly how much space his 14-foot frame occupies in corridors designed for smaller beings. His grey skin is mottled with fresh bruises—a purple-black tapestry across his arms and the visible side of his face. A gash along his temple has been hastily sealed with dermal tape. His eyes, still adjusting, still *seeing too much*, sweep the room with the haunted alertness of prey that has barely escaped a predator. Draped in a faded beige traveler's duster, he pulls it back into place after squeezing through the doorway, and readjusts his grey explorer's clothes, briefly revealing padded armor underneath.

Pulse #423, a floating and shifting cloud of gemstones and light, orbits his head in tight, worried circles, dimming with concern.

And then there are the others.

The shop is *full* of them. Ghosts. Dozens. They press against the walls, cluster in corners, drift between the displays of antique timepieces. A Vesk soldier with a hole through his chest meticulously checks and rechecks a pocket watch that isn't there. A Human woman in pre-Gap clothing weeps silently into hands that have long since faded. An Ysoki child—*Grandmother Niska's face flashes through Lowda's mind, and his heart clenches*—sits in a corner, clutching a broken toy, watching the living with hollow, longing eyes.

They're all here.

They're all *moving* toward this place. They seem fascinated by the people in the shop.

Lowda straightens slowly, his height making the already-cramped shop feel like a dollhouse. His voice, when it comes, is rough—exhausted, overwhelmed, but carrying that Sarcesian resonance that speaks to vocal chords hardened against the vacuum of space.

"I apologize for the door." As he speaks he moves his free hand in a cupping gesture toward his chest.

He's looking at Ophelius, but his gaze keeps flicking to empty spaces. To corners where nothing seems to be. To the Ysoki child.

"I'm still... adjusting. My name is Lowda Medina. I was told—" He stops. Swallows. His eyes land on the Ysoki child again, and something breaks in his expression. "I'm sorry," he says, making the cupping motion again, and for a terrible moment it's unclear whether he's speaking to the living or the dead. "I didn't mean to stare. It's just... there are so many of you. I'm not used to—"

He catches himself. His grey cheeks darken with something that might be embarrassment. "I'm sorry," he repeats, this time clearly to Ophelius and the gathered party. "I was directed here. By..." He trails off, gesturing vaguely at his head. At Pulse. At everything. "It's been a very long few days."

His large frame seems to fold slightly, a 14-foot creature somehow managing to look small and lost. "I don't suppose," he says quietly, "any of you heard a scream recently? A... very loud one? That showed you things you weren't meant to see?"

His eyes drift to the Ysoki child ghost again. "And if you could tell me why there are so many ghosts moving toward this shop, I would be... extremely grateful."

As Lowda speaks, the Ysoki child ghost slowly rises from its corner. It takes a hesitant step toward him. Then another. Its broken toy—a small starship with one wing missing—dangles from its translucent fingers. It stops a few feet from Lowda, looking up at the massive Sarcesian with hollow, longing eyes.

And it- no, she speaks.

Not aloud. Not in any language that has sound.

But Lowda *hears* her anyway—a tiny, fragile voice that reaches through the Echo's bond, a message meant only for the dead:

*"Can... can you see me? Really see me?"*

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-19 20:10:29):
The other ghosts in the shop have stopped moving. They're all watching now. Dozens of hollow eyes fixed on the 14-foot Sarcesian who stumbled through their door.

"Of course I can, little one. Why wouldn't-" Lowda catches himself and sighs, realizing that this child is not visible to anyone else, and looks up at the assembled group as he eases his back against a wall and slides down to sit with his knees pulled up in front of him, embarrassed again. "Apologies, they just seem so real sometimes, if I don't look closely enough..."

Lowda looks around at everyone and has a sudden realization, "Oh, void, I'm interrupting something. Sorry, it's just been a bit hard to focus since..." He trails off and his gaze and focus shifts to an empty corner of the room, listening intently.

"Yes, but even if they are the same as me, it doesn't mean they know anything more than I do." After a moment more he looks back at the group with an embarrassed smile, "Sorry, if I may start over, my name is Lowda, just arrived from the Diaspora. Do any of you know anything about these screams? I'd really like to start getting some answers instead of just more questions." He flicks a slightly irritated or exasperated look at the empty corner before returning his gaze to the group, and puts on the friendliest smile he can manage.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-20 13:52:26):
The Vlaka didn't notice the new visitor right away, but soon catches their scent and turns towards them. Following their movement, the shifting of their eyes around the shop, and their troubled speech. Reading their lips as they seem to be talking to beings that are not visible to anyone else. As their conversation shifts between everyone present and the specters they have been cursed to see and hear he makes his own choice. Stepping forward and getting on a knee in front of them he reaches out and puts a paw on their slumped shoulder as he reaches out telepathically with his augmentation.

"Forgive me for reaching out like this without asking first. I just felt you needed to hear 'me' and not a computer. I won't pretend to know what you have seen, past or present, but I understand the feeling of being confused and lost. I don't have any answers sadly, but I will help you in any way I can to find some and maybe bring you peace if you will let me try."

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-20 15:04:42):
Lowda's entire body goes still at the touch—a reflexive tension, the instinct of someone who has spent years in the dangerous spaces between asteroids, where unexpected contact means threat. But something in the Vlaka's posture, in the deliberate way he lowered himself to one knee despite the awkwardness of reaching up to a seated 14-foot creature, speaks of genuine care rather than aggression.

Then the voice comes. Not through the air. Not through the Echo's bond with the dead. Inside. Warm. Steady. Real in a way that computer-synthesized words could never be.

His eyes widen. The embarrassed smile falters, then softens into something raw and unguarded. For a long moment, Lowda just looks at the Vlaka—at the white fur, the braids, the goggles, the plugs. At a stranger who knelt in a crowded clock shop to put a paw on the shoulder of someone they'd never met.

The ghosts fade, just a little. Just for a moment. The Ysoki child watches with those hollow eyes, but she doesn't press closer. The others hold their distance.

Lowda's voice, when it comes, is quieter than before. Rougher. Stripped of the embarrassed apologies and the attempts to seem put-together. "You... you didn't have to ask." He swallows. His large hand moves slowly, carefully—giving Rune every chance to pull away—and rests briefly on top of the paw on his shoulder. A gentle pressure. A thank-you that doesn't need words.

Pulse #423 drifts down from its worried orbit, hovering near Rune's face for a moment—assessing, perhaps, or simply curious—before returning to its slow circuit around Lowda's head.

"I don't know your name," Lowda says, and there's something almost wondering in it, as if the normalcy of that question—what is your name, stranger who knelt for me—is a small miracle. "But I would like to. And I would like to accept your help. If you're sure you want to offer it."

His eyes flick briefly to the Ysoki child again, then back to Rune. "I should warn you—I see them everywhere now. The dead. They follow me. They talk to me. I'm still learning how to tell the difference between what's real and what's... not. For everyone else." A tired, self-deprecating smile. "Just a couple hours ago, I talked to a dock worker for five minutes before I realized he'd been dead for fifty years. He was very polite about it. Gave me directions to a restaurant that closed years ago." He laughs, but it's a shaky sound. "So if I suddenly start answering questions no one asked, or apologizing to empty corners—that's why. I'm not crazy. Just... new at this."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-20 17:00:48):
He rests there, his paw still resting on the large shoulder of the one before him. He has a gentle smile on his muzzle as he watches, listens in his own unique way. Giving the shoulder a gentle squeeze of comfort and understanding.

Rune's smile widens at the curious inspection by the floating gemstones. Such a strange sight to add to an already strange day.

When you laugh Rune joins you, much too loud and unrestrained before quickly giving way to an embarrassed and awkward smile as he quickly signs without thinking, his index finger moving from his ear to the edge of his muzzle. He then realizes that you probably don't understand and barely stops himself from relying on the automated message he programmed into his comm unit. Instead he waits and lets you finish your thoughts to avoid making things more awkward. Only when Lowda trails off does he offer explanation telepathically while simultaneously raising his other hand to the back of his head and blushes faintly beneath his fur. "I'm sorry for the outburst. I'm deaf. I've tried to learn to control my volume but never really got it right."

He takes a deep breath and shakes off the embarrassment then meets your eyes and gives a wide smile. "I'm Rune. It's nice to meet you." The Vlaka gives your shoulder a light squeeze. "And I can't speak for the others but I will not judge you or anyone else while we come to terms with and learn to control these new things that the scream has unlocked in us."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-20 18:04:15):
Miyu stares at the large person who entered the room, his fur's normal brilliance dimming to a soft flicker of pale yellow. He wasn't much a fan of scary stories, and this newcomer seems to be a walking one. 

"So... You see... Dead. People?" He asks in a soft tone, clearly afraid to rouse what is resting. What he had hoped to be resting.

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-20 19:59:13):
Lowda's eyes catch Rune's hands before the telepathic explanation arrives—the index finger moving from ear to muzzle, a gesture he recognizes even across species lines. His own hands rise reflexively, responding in kind:

[INDEX FINGER TRACES SMALL CIRCLE NEAR HEART] — "Understood."
[OPEN PALM PRESSES GENTLY FORWARD] — "No apology needed."

The Sarcesian signs are broader than Rune's, adapted for larger hands and the visual language of vacuum-raised people, but the intent is unmistakable. Lowda's tired smile warms at the corners.

"You're fine," he says aloud, for the others, while his hands continue:
[TWO FINGERS TOUCH LIPS, THEN MOVE TO PALM] — "Your voice is welcome."

Then Miyu's question cuts through, soft and fearful, and Lowda's attention shifts.

He looks at the Pahtra—really looks. At the fur shifting from brilliant to pale yellow, a living mood ring that makes something click in his exhausted mind.

"I do see them," he confirms gently. "But I'm not rousing them. I don't think I can. They were already here—I just... arrived after they did." He gestures vaguely at the shop. "They've been gathering since the second scream. The one eight hours ago."

He tilts his head, studying Miyu's fur with open curiosity.

"May I ask—are you Prismeni? Or touched by them?" He blinks slowly, and for the first time in good light, the others might notice his eyes: opalescent, shifting with faint rainbow undertones when the angle catches them right. "Your fur. It shifts like... like the Drift does. Like I do." A self-deprecating gesture at his own grey skin, which in certain light holds the faintest prismatic sheen. "I was born in the Drift. During a Prismeni event. It... left marks."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-20 20:29:29):
Suddenly, and without indication, Miyu's fur brightens and radiates its typical, colorful hue. His ears perk up, and the room once again turns into a lively lightshow as the colors bounce off the various reflective surfaces in the shop. 

"YOU WERE BORN IN THE DRIFT!?" He exclaims as he bounds across the room, attempting to get a closer look at Lowda. He stands as close as he can, trying to get their eyes level, but the height difference is far greater than he anticipated, so he focuses on the skin. 

"I was also born in the drift." He doesn't wait for a response; instead, he shifts his head slightly to the left and then back to the right, as if he is trying to read the sheen on Lowda's skin. "They say it's a good omen. Blessed by Triune, or something."

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-20 21:47:48):
Lowda blinks at the sudden brightness, at the Pahtra bounding across the shop with all the restraint of a solar flare. A surprised laugh escapes him—genuine, warm, cutting through the exhaustion.

"Easy, easy—" He holds up his large hands, palms out, but he's smiling. "I'm not going anywhere."

He watches Miyu study his skin, those shifting opalescent eyes patient and kind. At the mention of Triune, of blessing, something flickers across his face—a shadow that doesn't quite reach his smile.

"I've heard that," he says quietly. "The blessing part. My parents said the same thing, after."

He pauses. Glances at the Ysoki child ghost, still watching from her corner. At the others, drifting, waiting.

"The ship I was born on—The Resonant Chorus—it didn't survive the event. Forty-three crew." His voice is gentle, not grim, but the weight is there. "My parents made it out. Some others. Not everyone."

He looks back at Miyu, and there's no bitterness in his expression, only a kind of wondering sadness.

"So I don't know about blessing. But I know about... aftermath. About being marked by something that didn't ask permission first."

He brightens again, shedding the sadness, "But perhaps in the long run it may be seen to have been a blessing after all, who can say?"

"I'm glad you made it through yours, though. However you got here."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-20 22:18:22):
Miyu stops his inspection and takes a step back. His fur, still bright and colorful, has slowed in its shifting between colors.

"My friend," he locks eyes with Lowda, "there is not a single soul who asked for their first breath of life, but there are countless on their last that beg for more."

He smiles, as cheerfully as he can, "What was lost happened in spite of you, not because of you."

He turns back to the group, "So, are we going to that dock or not?" 

It seems Miyu had forgotten all about Lowda's ability to see and communicate with the dead. For the time being.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-21 02:38:58):
"I suggest we do. All of this information does not seem immediately actionable. Earning credits by completing the mission is and I have a feeling we will require money to prepare for whatever we seem to have been brought together for"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-21 06:25:02):
Chua listens and files away what each new entity has offered.  "Welcome, None of us have a real answer to why the scream occurred or why we were chosen to be affected and evolved by it.  However it is not a guarantee that we will see the end of this path either that the Universe has chosen us for wither.  Already I have seen others appear then simply die as the Universe no longer needed them around or found better options to work through.  Right now based on the temporal resonances around each of us. "  He expands his warp field and the math around everything is displayed once more.  Chua pauses and looks at it as he examines everyone that is gathered.  Then he says "We are what the universe wants in this exact moment.  However the universe is not providing us with a free credstick for food and supplies.  For that we have to work.  We currently have a job to locate a smuggler and retrieve some contraband.  If ⭐️Liv ⭐️ has found her voice she may be able to regale you with the stories of the first ones that set upon this path.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-21 13:04:01):
Rune, who had been waiting and listening to the exchange between his, hopefully, new friend and the vibrant feline. Who had seen the shifting in moods and the history and pain of his birth, the guilt he feels over something beyond anyone's control. And he silently sighed and took Lowda's hands, gently squeezing them, holding them for several moments of comfort and relative silence. Then he withdrew and started to speak with those same hands. Slowly, deliberately as he considered what he wanted to say to the haunted Sarcesian.

"Knowing that one's own existence is tied to such a painful event is a terrible burden to carry. I won't even pretend to truly know your feelings and what you have dealt with all these years. But I will listen if you ever wish to talk and maybe this event that brought us together will lead to a way to heal that wound in your heart "

As he finishes he once again puts that same paw back on that same shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-23 03:02:30):
"So are we going to proceed with our task or is someone going to suggest a new plan?"

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-23 03:39:49):
Lowda sits quietly through the exchange, gathering—Miyu's unexpected wisdom, Chua's cold mathematics of survival, the easy way the group shifts toward action. It's familiar, in a way. The rhythm of people who've learned to move forward because stopping means thinking, and thinking means feeling.

Then Rune's hands find his. He watches the Vlaka sign—slow, deliberate, clearly not his first language but offered anyway. The gesture matters more than the words. Someone learning his language to speak to him, not at him.

When the paw returns to his shoulder, Lowda covers it briefly with his own hand. "Thank you, Rune." Simple. Earnest. He meets those bicolored eyes and nods once.

His attention shifts to Chua, and something warm flickers across his exhausted features. The Ysoki's no-nonsense demeanor, the way he talks about the universe spitting people out and letting them die—it's pragmatic, sure, but there's care underneath. The kind of care Lowda learned in a creche full of ratfolk who took in strays.

"Chua Datafang." He says the name like he's tasting it, committing it to memory. "You remind me of someone. A friend, back in the creche. Grandmother Niska ran it—Ysoki, like you. She used to say 'the universe doesn't give you answers, it gives you chores. The answers come while you're doing them.'" A tired smile. "Sounds like you'd have gotten along."

Then Alita's question cuts through—direct, efficient, no wasted motion. Lowda finds himself appreciating it.

He pushes himself up, unfolding to his full height with a wince. The bruises from the first scream pull tight. Pulse #423 orbits a little faster, concerned.

"If you'll have me," he says, looking at Alita, then the group, "I'd like to tag along. I don't have answers either—just questions. And a feeling that whatever's happening, it's not done with us yet."

He glances at the ghosts—still watching, still waiting.

"Besides." A flicker of that self-deprecating smile. "I need to learn how to function like this. Might as well do it somewhere that pays."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-24 10:17:47):
Rune didn't immediately clue in to what was happening. He had been so focused on Lowda that he hadn't seen her as she made her presence known and before he knew it she appeared like a whirlwind of energy and glitter. As he tried to catch a breath and figure out what was going on she was doing a bizarre introduction, wondering if she is actually broadcasting or if this is just her 100% of the time.  Wait, what did she just call him? He's no dog.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 11:05:25):
@czarchasm23

You will see that the ghosts do not go close to Ophelius. 

You see Ophelius's eyes travel along the path of one of the ghosts. 

Potentially a coincidence but... 

It's likely Ophelius can see them too.

(I paid for the aeon rifle and gem out of my cash)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-24 16:45:43):
Miyu is enamored by the energy of this 'new' party member. Her upbeat attitude and dedication to her craft are inspiring. Almost instinctively, his fur began to pulse to the rhythm of her music.

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-02-24 17:42:45):
Lowda stands frozen for exactly three seconds too long as Livy's whirlwind descends upon them.

His hand, still extended from greeting Chua, gets captured and enthusiastically pumped before he can process what's happening. "Grey man that can see beyond... something" — he opens his mouth to correct her, to offer his actual name, but she's already gone, onto the next victim.

Pulse #423 orbits faster, clearly as overwhelmed as its partner.

Then something catches his attention. Something important.

Ophelius's eyes. Following a ghost.

Lowda's gaze tracks to the dwarf, then to the path his eyes just traced—empty space where a Vesk soldier stands frozen, watching the chaos with hollow amusement. The ghost notices Lowda looking, and waves.

Lowda blinks.

He looks back at Ophelius. The dwarf's monocle catches the light. Their eyes meet for just a moment—long enough.

You see them too.

The realization settles somewhere in his chest. *At least I'm not going crazy alone,* he thinks to himself.

Then Livy's song kicks in, Miyu's fur starts pulsing like a living strobe light, and Rune is clearly trying to decide if he's been insulted or just... Livy'd.

Lowda exhales slowly. A sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh as he watches ★Livy★ begin her attack on the dwarf. The Vesk soldier gives him a thumbs up.

"I'm not as well-equipped - or funded - as you may be, but I do have less tangible benefits I can offer," he says as he briefly focuses and lets his quantum field briefly Warp Reality just outside the shop's doorway, making the station outside appear to shatter like a mirror, each shard vibrating and rotating in place, giving a vague idea of shapes beyond but nothing definite. He focuses on the patterns in the field that he can use to make it briefly pulse and shift in time to ★Livy★'s music before letting the station stitch itself back together a moment later as he collapses the field.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-25 01:45:13):
Alita looks slightly started by Livy's entrance
"You act as an entertainer but I can detect some form of connection to the weave from you as well. Can you handle a fight? I have a suspicion those will be unavoidable given everyone else brought together."

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-02-25 01:47:22):
"If everyone agrees I propose we move out to smugglers dock and our objective"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-25 02:06:35):
Smirking he looks back to ⭐️Livy and then says.  "Alright get used to all of that.  This is why I thought the Universe decided she was no longer relevant.  I mean because she was so quiet  back at the dumpling shop."
