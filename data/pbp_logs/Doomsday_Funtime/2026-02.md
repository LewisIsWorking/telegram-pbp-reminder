**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-07 04:09:54):
The party arrive.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-07 04:09:58):
What do you all do?

@MrNegetZ

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:40:27):
You stand outside the temple of Pharasma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:40:41):
The gothic building stands in front of you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:41:25):
Assuming you all stand there for at least a few minutes, an acolyte will approach the party on her way back into the temple.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 15:41:52):
Female acolyte:
"Hello, the professor's friends. 

Can I help you...?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2026-02-16 15:46:59):
"Hello *master level in religion appropriate greeting for a priestess of this level* Carnon has a question for yourself, to do with your knowledge of this town. " They take a beat for a moment to allow her to take in the set up. 
"How would this party go about creating a large and foreboding statue that is magically enchanted to aid this town? Who would have the power to allow us to avoid several fetch quests and six hours of bureaucracy?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2026-02-18 16:16:36):
*[image]* Carnon is so good at knowing how to politely address priests

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:27:11):
Then she blinks again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:27:25):
Carnon causes her to freeze as if time itself breaks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:29:32):
Carnon said:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:32:59):
"Greetings, Sister of the First Spiral. 

May the Lady's eye fall upon you without falter, and may her judgment find your service worthy of the passage you shepherd."

Then Carnon performed a small inclination of his head. 

Carnon knew not to bow, Carnon inclinded his head. 

Pharasmin clergy don't bow to each other, typically. 

They incline, a sort of half bow. 

Bowing is often reserved for the dead.

Carnon then said:
"May the souls you tend pass gently from this threshold to the next, and may the Bones of the Hours count your days among the remembered."

A pause. 

Carnon's voice then shifted to a quieter more formal register as Carnon drops into something older. 

Archaic Pharasmian linguistics.  

The layer beneath the greeting is the part where most people outside the faith have never heard.

Carnon would say:
"I greet you in the space between the breath and the silence. 

I carry no false resurrection in my heart. 

I seek no reversal of what the Lady has spoken. 

I come to your threshold as the living come to the spiral, walking forward."

The last line is delivered with the right-hand open, palm up, fingers slightly apart. 

The Pharasmin gesture of candour.

 It means: 

- I hold no necromancy. 
- I hide no undead/undeath intentions. 
- My hands are empty of the Tyrant's work.

Carnon finishes with:
"May I enter your house with honest purpose, and may I leave it closer to the truth."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:33:14):
((( Max level Pharasma rizz )))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:34:16):
You have (Carnon has) just correctly performed an extremely high level Pharasmian greeting.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:34:51):
Where did Carnon pull this knowledge from?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:35:55):
It occurs to Carnon as quite strange, at first, perhaps a Pharasmian druid was amongst the druids. Maybe?
Or perhaps the hell knights? Unlikely.

Instead, it seems to come from something deep down, within the very aeonic material within Carnon's core.

... a memory that is not your own.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:36:39):
The acolyte below the hood of her gray robes visibly blushes at you Carnon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:37:14):
You have used such sacred speech.

The one reserved for acolytes who have taken their first spiral vow but not yet received the Grave Blessing.

The precise one for HER rank.

The one that tells her: this person has studied the lady of the Graves. 

This person knows the difference between a Dusk Attendant and a Pale Watcher and would never mix them up at a dinner party or a funeral service...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:39:14):
The acolyte:

"I... wow, that was... very... very kind of you."

A few seconds pass, and she says quickly, almost jumping:

"And, uh, VERY correctly rendered!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:39:47):
Her expression shifts from impressed and overwhelmed to a polite confusion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:39:52):
Acolyte:

"A... statue."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:40:04):
She looks at the rest of the party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:40:07):
The acolyte looks back at Carnon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:40:17):
Acolyte:
"That's... I wouldn't... I don't..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:40:21):
She glances over her shoulder at the temple doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:40:46):
Acolyte:

"That sounds like a question for Father Vauran. I can take you to him, if you'd like?"

She's already turning. 

This is above her station.

You know it. 

She knows it.

You know she knows it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:41:00):
She hesitates. 

Standing there for a moment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 03:42:21):
Acolyte:
"May I please ask... what kind of enchantment or infusion? 

What are your plans for this statue...? 

I can't really... help per say but I am deeply interested."

Genuine curiosity. 

Not suspicion. 

That greeting bought you a lot of goodwill and intrigue.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2026-02-24 15:23:35):
"An enchantment of protection, possibly. Possibly of healing. A statue to honour the fallen Professor, anyway. The enchantment itself is yet to be determined, as bureaucracy stands in the way of help yet again"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-25 01:20:52):
The professor is acknowledged locally as a strange esoteric guy but not a bad guy by a long stretch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-25 01:21:12):
Acolyte:
"That's... that's a lovely thought, I think. To honour the dead is very Pharasmian of you."
She tucks her books tighter under her arm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-25 01:22:09):
Female acolyte looks at you curiously:

"It is not my place to ask, but are you a follower of Pharasma?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-25 01:34:42):
The female acolyte shakes her head:
"Sorry I should have introduced myself. 
I am Sister Eladria, I am an acolyte here.
Cleric of the lady of the graves.
Record keeper of the temple."

Sister Eladria says the last two lines with a bit of confidence and pride that shines through.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:39:22):
What next? :)
