> The Automaton.
>> - The automaton cleaner is a squat, barrel-shaped thing on treads.
>> - Four articulated arms fold out from its chassis, two fitted with scrub-pads, one with a suction nozzle and one with a magnetic tool-arm for prying panels and clearing debris.
>> - Its sensor array blinks once, registering the charred remains of Bones on the floor.
>> - It rolls toward the corpse.
>> - It does not acknowledge any of you.
>> - It begins cleaning.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:32:11):
@Ravnos1 

Recall Knowledge (Computers) on the automaton cleaner.

Roll it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:32:25):
DC 14 computers check.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:41:28):
The robot cleaner cannot clean up the corpse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:41:48):
Going NEAR the corpse seems to cause it's circuity to react strange, causing it to shake.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:42:19):
The cleaning robot tries once more.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:42:22):
Z A P.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:42:36):
The robot short-circuits and gently beeps.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:42:49):
The door opens again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:47:49):
> The brig door is already open. The cleaning bot is still scrubbing.
>> - A figure steps through. Not the cleaning bot. This one is different. Taller. Broader.
>> - Mismatched plating across the chassis, one arm original factory spec, the other a crude weld-job that hangs slightly too long.
>> - Their "head" is a dome-shaped sensor array with a single row of optical sensors.
>> - Optical sensors glow a dull amber.
>> - A cleaning rag is tucked into a belt loop next to a ring of keycards.
>> - Behind this automaton, a pirate lingers in the corridor.
>> - The pirate is armed. Laser pistol drawn. Bored expression.
>> - The automaton looks at the charred, half-slime corpse on the floor.
>> - Then at the cleaning bot scrubbing it.
>> - Then at all of you, restrained and staring back.
>> - He sighs.
>> - It is a very mechanical sigh, servos whirring in something that sounds almost like exhaustion:
>> - "Great."
>> - The automaton follows this up with:
>> - "More mess."
>> - Then the automaton seems to actually notice you all:
>> - "Oh. You're all awake. Whatever. Probably will be more mess to clean up. I don't remember one of your friends being a cat man. How did they explode like that?"
>> - The automaton crouches beside the corpse, poking at the red slime with one finger.
>> - His amber optics flicker.
>> - "This isn't normal residue. This is transmutative. Partial polymorphic collapse. Fascinating. FASCTINATING. I wonder if I could... No. No, I shouldn't. That's not my job. I'm just a cleaner."
>> - They catch themselves.
>> - Stands back up.
>> - Grabs the cleaning rag and says:
>> - "I mean. Gross. Very gross. I'll mop it up."
>> - His robotic voice is tinged with defeat.
>> - The pirate in the corridor snorts:
>> - "Just clean it, tincan. And check their restraints while you're at it."
>> - The automaton's optics dim for just a moment.
>> - "... Yes. Of course. I'm cleaning now...." 
>> - He turns to the group.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-09 13:57:39):
Holis stares at the cleaning bot, and due to his panic of being all tied up, immediately thinks its an inquisitor droid here to torture them and begins to struggle even more violently against his restraints.   "No Stay away, I know nothing, Please.... let me go.!!."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-09 17:02:55):
*[image]* Joo-Dee isn't as tech-savvy as some of her companions, so she has a hard time identifying the cleaner, if she does at all. But it doesn't take an AI developer to notice that this cleaner is less than thrilled to be commanded by that pirate trash. She can see that it has desires that go far beyond those of a simple janitor. 

"Hey," She whispers, "What's fascinating about that goo?" She tries to start up a conversation.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-02-12 00:22:07):
In the meantime, Arctus continues to find themself facinated with the composition of the goo. They try to analyze its composition with the limited observation data from their senses.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-12 08:07:00):
.

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-02-13 12:41:27):
"What the fuck..." Damon mumbles as he watches the robot and the pirate in an annoyed way, but decides to maintain his silence as his eyes are mainly locked on the pirate this time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:38:22):
The automation's hand is in a wet brush scrubbing mode. 

As Joo-Dee's words settle, the brush stops. 

Pauses.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:38:50):
Amber optics turn toward Joo-Dee.

For a moment the only sound is the cleaning bot's motor and the distant pulse of the brig alarm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:40:58):
Cleaning automaton:
"...You actually want to know?"

The cleaning robot sits up.

His voice immediately changes, there's an excitement, a curiousity and a buzzing energy about it:

"It's not goo. 

Well. 

It is goo. 

But it's not JUST goo."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:53:41):
The robot's voice is quieter.

Quieter. 

It is unlikely the pirate in the corridor can hear.

The cleaning robot glances over one shoulder toward the pirate in the corridor.

The pirate is leaning against the wall, picking his nose furiously. 

Not paying attention.

The cleaning robot turns back to the group. 

The mindless cleaning bot continues zipping around the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:55:34):
The cleaning robot says the following quickly but quietly, barely above a whisper:

"The red substance is biological. 

It's a bunch of cellular matter that has been changed. 

Not just changed but changed mid-transmutation. 

Something was trying to change this body into something else. 

A slime, maybe. 

You can see where the cellular mass has become more primitive, well not primitive, streamlined and centralised in it's transfering of information.

But it didn't finish."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:57:00):
The cleaning robot continues:

"The process was interrupted by massive energy discharge."

The cleaning robot's optics flicker faster now. 

He is clearly excited and says: 

"The charring on the other half? 

That's not heat damage. 

That's dimensional friction. 

This body came through something...

A portal. 

A bad one. 

The kind that cooks you on the way through because the destination wasn't stable."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 19:57:27):
A pause.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 20:00:22):
The cleaning robot says much more quietly:

"I've read about this. 

In engineering journals I'm not supposed to have access to.

We take them from ships and sell them.

I...read them." 

The cleaning robot looks at the ground and says sadly:

"I'm not supposed to read engineering journals...

I'm not supposed to do a lot of things."

The cleaning robot looks at Joo-Dee properly for the first time. 

He acknowledges you as a real person, not a belonging of the pirates.

Amber optics steady, he asks:

"Who are you people?

I was told you are some nobody delivery runners."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-14 20:35:32):
Joo-Dee smiles at the robot, "We aren't nobodies.

Well.

We are nobodies. 

But we are not JUST nobodies."

She leans in a bit closer. "We are all friends of a professor. Tier-99. He's a brilliant robot. Just like you."

She tries to straighten herself up a bit, though it is quite difficult with only two limbs. 

"We could use a brilliant robot right now. 

One who reads engineering journals. 

One who would be fully permitted to read them on our crew."

She raises her eyebrows suggestively.

"If only we were not stuck in the brig guarded by a pirate..." She finally says while letting out a melodramatic sigh.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-14 23:11:07):
@StorybookRhizome 

Do you still want to do goo analysis?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-14 23:41:53):
Holis will start to scream as the interrogator droid begins to tickle torture his feet.  "Stop! no no I'll...Giggle....no... Chuckle.....Anything.....but that.....!pant...pant."  once the droid finished cleaning his feet off and moves away Holis just lays there trying to catch his breath.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-14 23:49:57):
You are not the AI....I am not paying the daddy tax....

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-14 23:51:21):
(dungeon crawler carl reference)

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-02-15 11:04:04):
Arctus chatters a bit to the cleaner bot as they get up, "As a bit of an engineer myself, I'd love to pick your circuits on a certain matter... Ah, perhaps this is not the right time for it however." Arctus droops a bit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 01:56:30):
@StorybookRhizome 

Attempt a Crafting, Arcana, or Occultism check for the analysis.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 02:02:11):
The cleaning robot looks at Arctus and says:
"Pick my circuits?"

The amber optics brighten for a fraction of a second.
The cleaning robot says:
"...Later. 
Yes. 
Later."

There is hope in that voice.

The cleaning robot moves to the next restraint.

Click.

Click.

Click.

Click.

One by one, you are all free.

The cleaning robot gestures to the floor.

Two panels left of the dead cat-man.

The cleaning robot pries them up.

Inside: your gear.

All of it.

Weapons.

Tools.

Personal effects.

The robot dog is in there too.

Powered down but intact.

Underneath your gear, wrapped in a tarp: a force field generator, a phase shield, magboots, and two incendiary grenades.

The cleaning robot says quietly:

"Those are mine.
I've been hiding them for months.
Take them."

The cleaning robot stands up and grabs the cleaning rag.

The cleaning robot says:

"I need to leave before he gets suspicious."

The cleaning robot nods toward the corridor and says:

"The pirate's name is Dekker.
Dekker is lazy but fast on comms.
You have seconds, not minutes."

The cleaning robot turns to go.

Pauses.

The cleaning robot says:

"My name is Ooofy."

Then Ooofy walks back toward the corridor, rag in hand, like nothing happened.

You are free.

You are armed.

Dekker is ten feet away and doesn't know it yet.

What do you do?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-16 05:52:25):
"Damn it guys," Joo-Dee whispers as she starts to quietly attach her limbs. "I'm a doctor, not a ninja. Can someone take down Dekker?"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-02-16 06:29:40):
"If we are all uncertain of our chances, perhaps we should all take a shot at it?" Arctus suggests while checking over their gear.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-02-16 06:30:00):
"Or him, as it were."

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-02-16 12:27:23):
"If nobody is doin' it, leave it to me." Damon takes his rifle and quickly assumes a firing stance.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-16 13:31:13):
Holis once free takes a moment (3 actions) to summon his hologram.  Quietly to Damon and everyone else.  "Once ready,  (I'll send my hologram in there (3 action act together) we Get'im. (1 action) and then It will also assist in taking it down.  (1 action move and 2 action attack)."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:33:31):
Dekker is leaning against the corridor wall.
Dekker's laser pistol is holstered.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:34:05):
You are all hidden and armed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:34:41):
It is obvious to the group that if Dekker survives the first round (or if anyone is loud) Dekker will attempt to call the bridge on his turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:34:50):
If that call goes through, the bridge knows.
If the call goes through, you have a ship full of pirates coming for you.
Do not let the call go through.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:35:19):
You may all roll initiative if you wish to attempt to kill him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:35:29):
You may roll with stealth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:35:32):
If you wish.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-23 23:28:33):
((Let's do it))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 07:57:58):
Highest roll is Damon with a total stealth of 28.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 07:58:00):
Players go first.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 08:08:10):

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-02-24 11:22:58):
*[image]* He takes a deep breath, watching through the sniper's scope as the world momentarily slows down through his senses. His prey stands there, right in front of him, and just like the old times, he pulls the trigger, but not without a smidge of hesitation he quickly throws away.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-02-25 00:26:08):
Arctus settles themself, chilling with focus, as a strange phenomena overlays itself on top of the room. They gently drift over to another party member and fiddles with their weapon, and under their touch, the weapon seems to come alive, taking a new form. 

[Free action Quantum Pulse, Move, and Casts Enhance Weapon on anyone that wants it]

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-25 02:01:18):
Then he acts together using 3 actions assigning 3 to the hologram and using his to boost the eidolon.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-25 02:02:09):
The eidolon strides quickly to the guard and attempts to kick it twice missing on the first strike and connecting with the second strike.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-25 18:57:52):
He still hasn't put on my "Get 'em"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:41:47):
I am nearly certain he is very very dead.
