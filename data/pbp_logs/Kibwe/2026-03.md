## Week 9 (Feb 23–Mar 01)

### 📅 Sunday, Mar 01

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 00:20:26):
He dusts himself off and walks over to stand close to the rift.

"Ready"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:35:39):
Bashevis looks sad but smiles at you:
"Don't forget me. LETS DO THIS!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:35:52):
Bashevis pours his flame magic into the rift.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:36:03):
The rift bursts into life.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:37:03):
You see the dwarf's form fall apart.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:37:43):
The entire form of Bashevis gets poured into the rift.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:37:48):
The platform shatters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:05):
But you do not have to worry about that because the rift grabs you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:13):
And...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:15):
Boom.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:29):
You are violently lurched through time and space once more.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:42):
You stand on the sandy ground of Kibwe's streets.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:38:54):
For everyone else:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:39:26):
Only seconds has passed since Fierce Leopard disappeared.

Now he has returned in a brilliant burst of white light.

He is on his hands and knees.
Covered in slime.
Stinking of blood and vomit.
Shaking.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:39:47):
Tal'lysae says quietly:
"...what did you see?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:40:55):
@MrNegetZ - Daichi Kenshin
@RyoYamakawa - Fierce Leopard Cyrus 
@Linksanelf2006 - Kieran
@Nemesiux - Lorn
@Ravnos1 - Master Cho Kobo
@buffetraider - Tarsus Longstaff

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 00:55:09):
Leopard gasps as he is ripped through the rift and appears once again on those dirt and cobblestone streets of his home, Kibwe. His body unsteady and struggling in ways he hasn't felt since he was young and pushed himself too hard. His head throbs as he attempts to look around, stopping as he sees the slime woman. He gruns as he mutters too loudly.

"Fuck off..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:05:37):
Tal'lysae says quietly:
"...fair enough."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:05:45):
The triceratops snorts nervously behind Kieran. @Linksanelf2006

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:06:20):
The merchant street is a mess.
Slime everywhere.
Monster parts (worth 300 GP!) are scattered across the cobblestones.
A shattered grandfather clock.
The brass automaton is still walking in confused circles.

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 01:39:28):
Struggling back to his feet he staggers for a moment before steadying himself.

"How is everyone? Have injuries been treated yet?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:40:21):
Tal'lysae:

"You've been gone for about 30 seconds."

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 01:41:23):
Leopard pauses, blinks, and looks around again before eloquently saying: "Huh?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:42:27):
Tal'lysae:

"How long do you think you were gone?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:30:04):
Tal'lysae:

"And who needs their wounds treated?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:41:17):
What next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 03:15:11):
"Several minutes at least. When I first arrived there I was not in the best state so I might have lost track of time at the start."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:20:28):
Tal'lysae nods slowly, she clearly wants to ask you something.

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 03:30:38):
He frowns and shakes his head.

"Wounded first, then we have a temple to get to. Or do we not want to stop this damned curse?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:39:56):
Tal'lysae remains silent.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:39:59):
Ok so

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:40:03):
Treat wounds!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:19:28):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:20:05):
*[image]* Second 10 minutes of treat wounds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:20:21):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:20:35):
Fierce leopard & Daichi Kenshin are all full health.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:20:39):
What next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:23:35):
20 minutes and everyone is grand.
