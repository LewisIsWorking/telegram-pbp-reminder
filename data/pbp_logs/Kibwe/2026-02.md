**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-08 20:32:33):
Daichi does his battle cry but the slime is imune to mental

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-08 20:32:44):
*[image]* He moves up, casts force fang and then enters arcane cascade(force).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-08 21:14:38):
@PathWars the slime takes 10 additional damage from thaumaturge mortal weakness to Cho Kobo's flurry

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2026-02-08 21:52:17):
*[image]* Tarsus rushes up to join the others, charging his staff with lightning and spellstriking the giant slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 00:33:57):
REACTION.

THE Dinosaur Merchant+Dwarf Cleric of Pharasma WHITE FLAME SLIME flickers in and out of reality.

P O P ! ! ! 

The slime seems to bend and warp reality.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 00:34:03):
AND TELEPORTS 105 FEET AWAY.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2026-02-09 01:03:52):
*[image]* Recognizing the spell as dimension door (translocate), Tarsus attempts to counter it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:04:38):
Rank 4 or 5 Translocate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:06:54):
Please describe how Tatsus Longstaff does this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-09 01:06:56):
It's so cool!

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2026-02-09 01:12:23):
As a dimensional rift opens behind the slime and it moves to escape, Tarsus creates a similar rift in the same space, collapsing both effects into nothing.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:28:53):
so when the slime tried that was it a manipulate, concentration or move action?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:29:17):
@PathWars

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:34:33):
oh ok

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:44:52):
not necessarily. his counterspell is also a reaction...so would 2 different peoples reactions go off? just checking for my on clarifications.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-02-10 04:45:06):
But ty for the answer on the teleport.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-13 16:33:25):
Daichi bonks the slime very hard as it tries to teleport.
His staff empowered by his previous spell. (he will not knock the slime away.)

Then I manually applied the extra 10 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 01:35:15):
If the slime had bones, they would be broken.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 19:18:26):
- Critical hit, no critical damage due to being a slime.
- 34 damage becomes 17 due to no sneak attack and no critical damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 19:18:31):

The slime attempt to EAT you.

Do you want to Hero Point reroll any of these check?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 20:50:57):
@Linksanelf2006 

Kieran Hero Points the reflex save into a 24 (11 on the roll).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 20:51:06):
Which is a failure up from a critical failure.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 20:51:16):

@Linksanelf2006 

Daichi and Kieran are inside two big tendrils of the slime.

- Slowed 1.
- Grabbed.

You must either do an escape check or rupture the creature's arms to get free.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:03:29):
The creature's movement shake reality: 22 force damage.

Tarsus takes half: 11 force damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:04:24):
None of you are on HP, all of you have stamina remaining.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:06:33):
The slime attempts to force Daichi through a portal inside of itself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:07:55):
It fails both times but you take 24 & 21 force damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:07:59):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:35:52):
Or else your critical effects won't apply.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 21:35:56):
I'm going to roll

I didn't have to do anything.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-16 21:36:51):
It had crushing already

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-16 21:37:01):
You added from when I attacked during my turn.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-16 21:37:29):

Do you have your reaction?

Fierce Leopard, you launched your assault against the slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 23:17:14):
The slime opens a portal inside of itself to teleport itself AND your allies 100+ feet away!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 23:17:27):
Tal'lysae yelled out:
"AIM FOR THE PORTAL, STEP INTO IT!"

((( Using her slime lore )))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 23:17:39):

Fierce Leopard, you are far far far from home.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:44:19):
Far from Kibwe.

You are on your knees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:44:46):
Your vision is blurred.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:45:33):
You throw up violently onto whatever you are currently placing the flat of your palms onto.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:45:51):
You taste blood in the vomit as it passes through your mouth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:46:28):
A clearly dwarvish voice speaks:

"It may seem grim, laddie, but you are lucky to survive the trip. Very few do."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:54:33):
@RyoYamakawa 

Fierce Leopard, do you wish to respond?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:58:28):
You can't quite move yet.

The paralysis has not quite faded yet.

It IS fading, by the second, but not just quite yet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 17:58:56):
It's fairly likely you've experienced teleportation before.

Or at the very least you know/have seen people be teleported.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-18 18:00:10):
Teleportation doesn't make you feel out-of-body, it doesn't make you upchuck blood and it doesn't make your whole body paralysed.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-18 18:02:33):
Leopard coughs out a bit more bile and blood, spitting to try and clear his mouth before he tries and fails to lift his head. The burning, scarring sensation of puking makes his voice hoarse as he responds to the voice of the person who seems to be close by.

"T-That is the last time I trust a slime person who tells me to step into a portal."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-18 19:30:00):
"As long as it doesn't involve portals and whatever the hell happened coming through that one in particular I'll agree to look. No promises on touching however."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:15:52):
Paper-Stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:16:44):
Your head raises. 

You about yourself now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:17:06):
You are on this platform in the endless void of what seems to be space.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:17:58):
It is not possible to see infinitely because dark storming clouds filled with pulses of black lightning block out the far lines of your vision.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:23):
But there's something moving in these dark clouds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:31):
Masses of metal. HUGE masses of metal.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:38):
Starships.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:48):
Hundreds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:50):
Thousands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:18:55):
Hundreds of Thousands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:19:52):
Each one is impossibly large. 

If you were to fly across the void, you would be a speck against these ships.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:20:02):
They fill every gap between every cloud in every direction.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:20:36):
And in some of the cloud there are other.... things. Tendrils. Eyes. Yellow glowing eyes...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:20:49):
You instinctively look away.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:20:54):
It is literally too much for your mind.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:21:11):
You can feel the immensity of what you are witnessing shredding away at your sanity.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:22:20):
The white flame dwarf speaks to you, Fierce Leopard:

"Aye, laddie. 

By the lady of the graves and the white flame, it is too much to bear, too much to witness."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:32:59):
You see behind you, Fierce Leopard, that there is a rift, a schism of magic, the remnants of the portal.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-22 03:35:11):
The white flame dwarf:

"I can get you home.

When you're ready."

The white flame dwarf tries to help lift you, then says:

"Maybe squint. No use you going back as a potato. You've got a city to save..."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-23 02:44:14):
As he pushes himself up onto all fours and can truly take in what is around him he freezes. The void, the nothingness, and then beyond. Those menacing storms of darkness, lightning almost as dark as the void itself, and those metal monstrosities. And then the eerie things that lurk behind it, the eldritch beings that feel like they are there just to torment him further. What is all this and why did it lead him here to see it. He snarls at the ghostly slime dwarf.

"What the hell is this? Why am I here to see it? This isn't about the city. So why? Why?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 05:35:49):
Dwarf:
"And THAT is coming. 
Coming for you all.
Whether you saw it or not. 
Whether I showed you or not."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 05:41:37):
Dwarf continues:
"Pharasma did not prepare me for this."

Dwarf continues:
"I gave her 80 years of clerical service..."

Dwarf continues:
"I gave my life to her... It'll all be for nothing, well it would have been if I had not been saved by another..."

Dwarf:
"The flame. Grey. Very Very Old. 
Older than her."

Dwarf continues:
"I don't know its name. 
The name is hidden."

Dwarf continues:
"But it showed me all this..."

He grabs your arm.
You feel nothing.
His hand passes through you.
He doesn't seem to notice.

Dwarf says to Fierce Leopard:
"Follow the flame, laddie. 
Find it. 
Whatever it is."

Dwarf:
"Or none of it matters. 
Not Kibwe. 
Not your friends. 
Nothing."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-26 00:45:51):
@RyoYamakawa

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-26 01:32:45):
Leopard takes in the dwarf's words and looks between him and the vicious and enormous "ships" out in that sea of darkness and blackened light.

"Ok... I will try and warn the others. Find this flame. Stop this or prepare others to be ready in whatever future this is brought about in."

He pushes himself to his feet and inspects his body to check for injury beyond his tormented throat and stomach.

"Just hope they believe me. And now I am wondering if the red slime woman knew what lay on the other side of the portal."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:13:42):
...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:19:31):
Bashevis nods.
Slow.
Heavy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:19:51):
Bashevis looks you over.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:20:18):
Bashevis:

"You'll be ok.

Your allies will patch you up laddie."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:20:50):
The platform shudders.
A piece the size of a minecart breaks off and tumbles silently into the void of space.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:21:13):
Bashevis glances at the rift behind you.
It's barely a crack now.
A thin line of light in all this dark.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:21:17):
Time is running short.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:22:48):
Bashevis's voice is different now; you can hear sadness, regret and fear in his voice:
"She knew.
She...he....they all wanted you to see.
It's not fair on you.
It's not easy on you.

But..."

A sad sigh from Bashevis.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:23:34):
Bashevis:

"We need you.

Or it'll all be for nothing.

We lost Lorn, our numbers are few.

They have to be few or..."

Bashevis shakes his head.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:23:43):
Another chunk of platform falls.
Closer this time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:24:06):
The paper-stone is cracking. 

The magical bubble you exist in is fading.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:24:15):
Bashevis looks down at his own hands.
The white flame is barely there now.
More grey than white.
More nothing than grey.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:29:17):
He walks toward the rift.
He is about to press both of his hands into the crack.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:29:31):
Bashevis steels his voice:
"Ready?"

@RyoYamakawa

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 21:37:12):
Bashevis's very essence is trailing off him like wisps of smoke into the rift.
