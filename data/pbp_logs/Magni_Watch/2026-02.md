**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-07 20:07:12):
A pause. 

Then, quieter. 

Barely a hiss carried on the warm air from inside. 

Words in Draconic.

Voice 1:
"Doopa, fountain room. 
Wait for the plates. 
Kreski. 
Ceiling, with the spider. 
Rekarek..."

A second voice cuts in. 
Deeper. 
A snarl barely held in check. 
Also in Draconic.

Voice 2:
"I don't take orders from you, mage."

Voice 1: 
"Skerix."

Voice 1 says sharp and fast:
"You take orders or you get us all killed by the city guard, you bloodthirsty idiot. 
Stay in the offering hall. 
Let the traps do the work. 
If they make it to you, THEN you can have your fun."

A low growl. 
Then silence.
Nadya hears every word.
The rest of the party sees only the empty gateway. 
The warm air drifting out from inside. 
The faintest sound of movement.
Claws on wood, something being dragged into position.

Changer's glass eyes pulse once:
"Thermal signatures detected. 
Multiple. 
Dispersed across the ground floor."

Changer continues:
"They are not concentrated at the entrance."

Changer continues:
"This is not a defensive formation. 
This is a kill box."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-08 01:29:41):
Nadya sighs and translates as she hears, quietly passing on the information via a series of message spells.

"Yeah. Are we sure this is the only way in?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-08 02:08:24):
Getting nothing useful out of the former employer, Báyakan takes the message spell as his cue. Zipping about the building, he looks for some other means of getting in that might not involve cutting through a trap infested killzone.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-09 06:51:30):
Returning to the others, the detective makes his report. He also promptly sits on someone's boot for a few moments while catching his breath. Bending space and time to move quickly for that long is a bit tiring.

"For my coppers about it, there are probably far less traps somewhere 'round the back. Perhaps around where that flimsy parchment wall is."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-09 16:48:21):
Akuma looks a bit saddened, "I was really hoping they were in trouble. But it appears they are the trouble." 

He draws his katana, mostly to keep it in hand in case something happens in the discussion, "What's the plan? Should one or more of us still try using the front to not raise suspicion to those entering elsewhere?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-09 17:05:52):
The bat snorts a little. "They are wronged, and deserve whatever revenge they intend. However, according to the city's laws, I am fairly certain they are a threat to be neutralized."

He actually pauses to glance at the city golem at this point for confirmation. Either way the thing responds, he assures Akuma, "I believe your steel would be better applied to whichever one is eager to fight than whatever awaits in the fountain room."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-09 17:31:11):
"Setting up deadly traps is not appropriate revenge." Akuma disagrees, "What if a child or another worker had entered with all the commotion outside?"

"But we can argue the ethics of the situation later... That thing is in the offering hall, yes?" He asks. "Anyone know the closest entrance to it?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-09 19:19:15):
A strange smile. Still far too many teeth showing. 

"My "ethics" are simply not in line with your legal system. Came to terms with that some time ago. So far as the offering hall goes, we could ask the front desk. But it does seem that going up and in through the back should spook the kobolds enough to draw out whoever wants to fight."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-09 20:01:56):
*[image]* "Is this really necessary? We don't even know why they have escalated this much so quickly? What if someone is using them to get back at the city or something?" Kitt looks between the other members of the Watch. "I was always taught that Kobolds like me usually only act like this when they believe they have a strong support to back them and lead them. We're usually more careful and cautious, not outright aggressive like they are right now."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-09 23:05:56):
"All the 'morality' and 'why' crap is for the Justice Court. We've got a simple set of orders that we need to carry out, even if you don't like it. There's ways to be upset about working conditions that don't endanger the public."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-09 23:20:21):
The detective shrugs and laughs. 

"Not much for thinking it through, huh? Well the Justice Court isn't about to come down here and handle this. We are. The back way involves a little climb it looks like, but seems safer from traps. The front, as pointed out, is something of a kill box. Kitt is probably onto something. If there is strong leadership, neutralizing it could take the fight out of the others. Bigger folk with bigger weapons first, either way."

The suited bat readies what appears to be a whip, but is obviously not inclined to enter first. From either direction.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-09 23:28:01):
Nadya shrugs back.

"I'm more worried about the missing people. If this turns out to be related, I'll try to restrain the apathy. We can interrogate em after we neutralize the threat part. From the back way, if it's a vote."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-09 23:30:01):
Akuma nods in agreement with Nadya and Báyakan. He then says, "Changer, can you enter through these doors in about 10 minutes? Offer them one chance to surrender." 

He then begins walking around the building, looking for a good starting point for the climb up.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-09 23:33:58):
Báyakan glaces up, trying to determine if the distance is short enough to just fly. Probably if he moves beam to beam and goes slow enough.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-09 23:41:19):
*[image]* ((Akuma's 'climb' check. I probably won't be on for the rest of the evening.))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-12 08:06:38):
.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-15 23:23:31):
@ChaseDarkthorne
Báyakan attempting the climb. Do you have Evanescent Wings, or are we rolling Athletics? DC 10.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-15 23:24:02):
@ArtyArtillery @RyoYamakawa
Nadya and Kitt. You climbing too? DC 10 Athletics.
The paper-and-lattice wall panels are within arm's reach from here.
Thin. One clean cut and you're inside.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-15 23:24:04):
Meanwhile, Changer stands at the base of the marble stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-15 23:24:15):
Changer:
"Do you wish me to also climb...?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-15 23:27:14):
*[image]*

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-15 23:55:48):
bonus there was meant to be item, whoops

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:12:17):
Changer at a loud volume:

"I shall offer them a chance now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:12:43):
Changer walks up to the doors at the front of the trade house.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:13:16):
As you all stand upon the "top" of the building.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:13:51):
Changer is less than 10 metres from you all, but he is of course, on the ground level.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:15:04):
Change knocks on the front doors and says:

"By the powers vested in me by the city-state of Magnimar, the city of Monuments, you are all ordered to surrender yourselves to the Guards of the Magni Watch."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:15:08):
No answer.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:15:21):
As you all stand upon the 1st floor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:15:30):
You feel a warm heat rising from the room below.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:16:04):
I'll say with your passive perceptions, you can hear a gentle bubbling sound and that of a quick rushing water.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:19:05):
Also, I'll say that anyone with legal/Magnimar lore would know that you can cause damage to the building if you need to, but avoiding it would be a "better" outcome.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-23 23:31:47):
Akuma will attempt to move into the building as quietly as he can, though he isn't really built for stealth, hoping that the great noise that Changer is producing will distract those nearby. His goal is to try and get eyes on as many of the kobolds or others as possible.

((DF forge is offline, so I cannot roll, please roll for Akuma when available))

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-02-24 08:13:18):
The detective traces an eye upon his own forehead that glows briefly before quietly following Akuma. He remains prepared to have his guiding eyes help out, if they can.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-24 09:35:42):
Kitt softly hums under their breath to draw on the esoteric before following behind the others.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-24 18:56:04):
*[image]* ((Akuma's stealth roll))

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-24 19:01:08):
*[image]* Kitt's stealth roll

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-24 21:35:03):
*[image]* sneaky

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:25:50):
The Magni Watch breach from the roof.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:25:57):
You attempt to do it quietly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:26:07):
Nadya in particular is a bit noisy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:26:49):
You see before you a room with a female kobold guarding a large water fountain.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:27:18):
She is holding some kind of detonator switch

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:27:51):
It'll also be obvious from the angle of your approach as you all drop into the room that the front entrance is very much rigged with various traps.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:27:59):
Of which you all avoided them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:28:10):
Now the problem: the kobold hears a couple of you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:28:20):
But not Kitt.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:28:26):
The Kobold spins around.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:29:12):
The kobold screeches out at the group, I'll say she doesn't notice Kitt who could have dropped behind a crate or something.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:29:57):
The kobold swears in draconic.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:31:43):
The female kobold says in broken common:
"You. You not supposed to be THERE."

Her claw tightens on the detonator.

Her eyes dart to the front entrance. 

Then back to the group. 

Then to the front entrance again.

She was ready for the front door.

Not this.

Female kobold:
"Stay...

Stay back. 

I pull this, everyone gets boiled. 

BOILED!!!"

Her voice cracks on the second one.

She's young. 

Shaking.

But determined.

@ChaseDarkthorne @TylerLink @ArtyArtillery @RyoYamakawa
Kitt is unnoticed behind a crate. The rest of you are facing a very nervous kobold with a dead man's switch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-28 02:32:09):
The fountain's water is boiling, you can feel the warm room filled with the water's heat.
