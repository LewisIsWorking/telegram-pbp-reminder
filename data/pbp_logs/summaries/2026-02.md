## C07 · Hopeful End-Times (Starfinder 2e)

**Status:** Shopping & party assembly. No combat.
**Location:** Castle-Counting, Ophelius Berrus's timepiece & arms shop, Little Akiton, Absalom Station.

The party visited Ophelius Berrus's shop, a clockwork wonderland of synchronised timepieces and firearms. Chua Datafang had a philosophically charged exchange with Ophelius about harmonic variance and the Scream's effects — choosing an uncalibrated Commercial Aeon Rifle over the flashier Tactical model because he could *hear* that the factory-tuned weapon was out of sync with his warp field. Ophelius recognised something in Chua ("I know what it looks like when the universe has put its hands inside someone and rearranged the intervals") and sold him the rifle plus a Phantasmal Minion spell gem at a fair price.

Meanwhile Miyu discovered he could synchronise Ophelius's clocks by dancing — his chromatic fur pulses aligned five pendulums in under a minute, a task that normally takes Ophelius a week by hand. Alita tested weapons on the shop's hard-light firing range.

Ophelius let slip a reference to his sons ("I was wrong about what they needed...") before catching himself. **Lowda noted that ghosts avoid Ophelius, and that Ophelius's eyes tracked a ghost's path — strongly implying he can see them too.**

Two new party members joined: **Rune**, a deaf Vlaka AbadarCorp courier who heard the Scream despite his lifelong deafness, communicated via telepathy node and sign language, and formed an immediate bond with Lowda. **Lowda Medina**, a 14-foot Sarcesian drift-born who sees and speaks with the dead since the Scream, arrived battered and overwhelmed, accompanied by ghosts and his companion Pulse #423. His entrance was a dramatic set piece — dozens of ghosts flooding the shop, an Ysoki ghost child asking if he could truly see her.

**★Super Idol Livy★** also burst back onto the scene in full broadcast mode, rattling everyone with her chaotic energy. The party debated heading to Dock 3 for a smuggler retrieval mission, but Rune needs to retrieve his Shirren-Eye sniper rifle from home first. Month ends with the party still at Castle-Counting, preparing to move out.

**Plot seeds:** Ophelius's pocket watch counting down ~9 years. The Korvosian Palace grandfather clock showing 4710 Rova 10th. Ophelius can likely see ghosts. His comment about his sons. The ghosts congregating at the shop.

## C06 · Kibwe (Pathfinder 2e)

**Status:** Combat completed → solo vision sequence.
**Location:** Kibwe streets → extradimensional void.

The month opened mid-combat against the **Dinosaur Merchant + Dwarf Cleric of Pharasma WHITE FLAME SLIME** (250 HP). Round 1 was devastating — the party dealt 143 damage total, with Daichi Kenshin's Attack of Opportunity (29 damage crit) and Tarsus's Counterspell cancelling the slime's teleport being the standout moments. The slime retaliated by trying to swallow the front line; Daichi and Kieran got caught inside (Slowed 1, Grabbed), and Daichi took 45 additional force damage from failed dimensional rift attacks.

Round 2 escalated: the slime attempted to teleport again. Tal'lysae (master in Slime Lore) shouted for Fierce Leopard to step INTO the portal. He trusted her and stepped through.

**Fierce Leopard vanished from Kibwe entirely.** He arrived on a crumbling paper-stone platform in an endless void — vomiting blood, paralysed, far from anything he's ever known. The dwarf spirit **Bashevis** was there waiting. Around them: hundreds of thousands of impossibly large starships filling every gap between black storm clouds crackling with dark lightning. Eldritch things with yellow glowing eyes lurked behind the clouds. The vision was sanity-shredding in scale.

Bashevis delivered the campaign's central warning: *"That is coming. Coming for you all."* He spoke of serving Pharasma for 80 years, but being saved by something older — a **Grey Flame, older than Pharasma herself**, whose name is hidden. He urged Fierce Leopard to follow the flame. *"We need you. Or it'll all be for nothing. We lost Lorn, our numbers are few."* The platform crumbled as Bashevis used the last of his fading white flame essence to push Leopard back through the closing rift.

Back in Kibwe, the remaining party found 300 GP of slime monster parts scattered on the ground.

**Plot seeds:** The Grey Flame (older than Pharasma). The armada vision. Bashevis's statement "We lost Lorn, our numbers are few." The slime woman deliberately engineering this vision. Bashevis's connection to Pharasma and the white flame fading to grey.

## C00 · Riddleport (Pathfinder 2e)

**Status:** Social / exploration at the Silver Succubi casino.
**Location:** The Silver Succubi, Riddleport.

The party is scattered across Marlo's casino in a social chapter. **Rax** played bartender-therapist, managing the hyperactive Lenma Moonshine while building rapport with **Callie Dusk-Barrel**, the bar's owner. Callie warned that Marlo (the crime lord) is coming downstairs to see the prisoner Beltias (in chains), and begged everyone — especially Moonshine — to behave. She revealed Moonshine got fired from the Silver Succubi two years ago for being too drunk *on shift*, was rehired the next morning, and never showed up. She still owes Callie an apology.

**Necrila** (the undead-adjacent shark-toothed severed-head-collector) had a tense but fascinating exchange with **Eliola**, a Cyphermage initiate studying Sin Empire magic. Eliola was intellectually intrigued rather than frightened by Necrila's claim of feeling a "magical attraction" — she's wearing an amber pendant and studying sin script texts. She firmly corrected that nobody can "just use" sin magic; the Cyphermages study it, not practice it.

**Gobu** overcame his terror of Necrila long enough to bond with Eliola ("Hope so, for your sake!"), then wandered off to find the band. He discovered a battered **vending machine** ("GAS FORGE PROVISIONS — INSERT COIN, RECEIVE GOODS, NO REFUNDS, NO COMPLAINTS") and got lucky when the mechanism jammed — two-for-one. He received a **Moderate Healing Potion** (labelled, standard) and a mysterious **dark green vial** with no label, thick sludge-like liquid that smells of wet fur and copper. Not poison. Seems like an altered/expanded healing potion. Something that was NOT supposed to be in that machine.

**Mira Ashvane** (another Cyphermage) and Necrila sparred over naming conventions and fiend-eating. Necrila ended the month staring at the caged imp like a predator eyeing dinner.

**Plot seeds:** The unlabelled green vial in the vending machine. Eliola's amber pendant and sin magic studies. Marlo's imminent arrival to see Beltias. Callie and Rax's developing rapport.

## C09 · Metal City (Starfinder 2e)

**Status:** Brig escape → combat initiated.
**Location:** The Stargazer (pirate vessel), brig corridor.

The party woke restrained in the brig of a pirate ship with a charred, half-slime corpse on the floor (their former companion "Bones," killed mid-transmutation). A cleaning bot tried and failed to clean the remains — the corpse shorted it out.

Enter **Ooofy**, a mismatched-plating automaton janitor with a secret intellect. Joo-Dee spotted that Ooofy had desires beyond janitoring and struck up a whispered conversation. Ooofy analysed the corpse residue with scientific precision — identifying it as interrupted mid-transmutation (something was turning the body into a slime), with "dimensional friction" charring from an unstable portal. He admitted to reading stolen engineering journals he's "not supposed to have access to."

Joo-Dee's pitch was perfect: *"We could use a brilliant robot right now. One who reads engineering journals. One who would be fully permitted to read them on our crew."* Ooofy freed everyone, returned their gear (plus his own hidden stash: force field generator, phase shield, magboots, two incendiary grenades), revealed the guard's name (**Dekker**), and walked out like nothing happened.

The party rolled stealth initiative (Damon's 28 highest), and opened fire on Dekker. Damon sniped, Holis sent his holographic eidolon in for kicks, Arctus cast Enhance Weapon. By month's end Dekker is "very very dead" and the party is free and armed aboard a pirate ship.

**Plot seeds:** Bones's interrupted slime transmutation — who/what was doing it? The unstable portal. Ooofy's hidden intelligence and desire for freedom. The wider pirate ship still unaware.

## C01 · Doomsday Funtime (Pathfinder 2e)

**Status:** Social / exploration. Very slow month.
**Location:** Temple of Pharasma, Raven Grow. Day 1/30, Arc 11.

Session 272 opened with the party arriving at the Temple of Pharasma in Raven Grow. An acolyte approached — and then **Carnon absolutely demolished** the social encounter. He delivered a pitch-perfect formal Pharasmian greeting in archaic liturgical form, correctly identifying the acolyte's exact rank (post-first-spiral-vow, pre-Grave-Blessing), using the right gestures (the palm-up sign of candour meaning "I hold no necromancy, I hide no undeath intentions"), and speaking in the sacred register reserved for her station.

The greeting came from somewhere deep in Carnon's aeonic core — a memory not his own. The acolyte, **Sister Eladria** (cleric, record keeper), was visibly flustered and impressed. Carnon asked about building a magically enchanted protective statue to honour the fallen Professor. Eladria referred them to **Father Vauran** but was genuinely curious about the enchantment plans.

Carnon revealed he's "between gods" after recent changes. Viki (DragonFox) perked up at "record keeper." The month ends with introductions still happening outside the temple.

**Plot seeds:** Carnon's inherited Pharasmian memory (from what/whom?). Sister Eladria as potential ally/information source. Father Vauran as the authority figure. The statue project as a potential anchor for protective magic over Raven Grow.

## C04 · Magni Watch (Pathfinder 2e)

**Status:** Infiltration → standoff.
**Location:** Kobold-occupied trade house, Magnimar.

The Watch discovered that kobolds had fortified a trade house into a kill box — Nadya overheard draconic planning: Doopa in the fountain room, Kreski on the ceiling with a spider, Skerix in the offering hall for direct combat. Changer (the city golem) confirmed dispersed thermal signatures: "This is not a defensive formation. This is a kill box."

The team debated approach: front door (trapped) vs. roof breach. Kitt (kobold PC) questioned whether someone was manipulating the kobolds into aggression. Nadya cut through the ethics debate: *"All the 'morality' and 'why' crap is for the Justice Court."* They voted for the back way.

Everyone climbed the building (DC 10, all succeeded). Changer walked to the front door and formally demanded surrender. No answer. The team dropped through the roof into the fountain room — bypassing all the front-door traps.

Problem: Nadya was too noisy. The room's occupant, a **young female kobold named Doopa**, spun around holding a **dead man's switch** connected to the building's boiling water system. She was shaking, clearly young and scared, but determined: *"Stay back. I pull this, everyone gets boiled. BOILED!!!"* Her voice cracked on the second one.

Kitt is unnoticed behind a crate. The rest of the Watch face a nervous kobold with a detonator and a room full of boiling water.

**Plot seeds:** Who/what radicalised these kobolds? The missing people (Nadya's primary concern). Doopa as a potential sympathetic figure. The kill-box sophistication suggesting external leadership. Kitt's undetected position.

## C05 · Grand Explorers (Pathfinder 2e)

**Status:** Puzzle / skill challenge completed.
**Location:** Gnomish fortress, hydraulic control room.

A technical month. The party found a gnomish hydraulic system — a massive pressurised water tank connected to pipe networks, valve wheels, and gauges, all labelled in Gnomish. Between Illiani, Cyrus, and Axtra, they translated the labels ("Main Flow — Hydraulic Seal Release," "Pressure Line 3," "Emergency Vent").

Illiani spotted the danger: the main tank was bulging, gauges deep in the red, dangerously over-pressurised. Axtra understood the full picture — the pipes connect to hydraulic locks on the reinforced doors to the central building. This valve is the way in. But the over-pressurisation was intentional: an emergency lockdown by the gnomes.

Three emergency vent valves needed bleeding in sequence (3 Crafting successes required). Axtra nailed the first (23), failed the second, Hero Point rerolled to 22 — success. Steam screamed, gauges dropped to green, and two sets of locks disengaged simultaneously: the reinforced doors into the fortress's highest section AND a broom closet door.

Both doors now open. What's inside either one remains unknown.

**Plot seeds:** Why did the gnomes lock down so desperately? What's in the broom closet (hidden secondary objective?). The central building's contents. The intentional over-pressurisation suggesting the gnomes were sealing something IN, not keeping people OUT.

## C08 · Theria (GM: Tyler/Link)

**Status:** Travel, combat, social. New party member recruited.
**Location:** Open fields → Wanhoop Swamp → unnamed village inn.

The party (Heron, Berekit, and new companion **Leaf** — an adorable plant construct created by the goddess Atrix whose entire vocabulary is "I am Leaf!") was released from military custody in the city and headed south toward Wanhoop Swamp. Atrix created Leaf as a scout/rogue-type companion with impeccable direction sense and sticky fingers (immediately stole Heron's coin pouch). Limited intelligence, but deadly with a shortsword.

En route they fought an **oversized Cockatrice** on a bridge over a rot pit. Three-round combat: Heron tanked (Shielding Taunt, repeatedly failed Trip attempts), Berekit sniped with Gouging Claw spellstrikes, and Leaf delivered the killing blows from behind. Heron took a critical peck near the eye but made his Fortitude save against petrification. The cockatrice was notably larger and hardier than normal — foreshadowing the swamp's corruption.

They reached a **decaying village** — fifty-odd mud-stained buildings, many cracked or collapsed, almost deserted. Melancholy everywhere. At the inn they met **Quacksalver**, a hobgoblin alchemist harvesting medicinal swamp roots. Heron was immediately suspicious of his mutagens ("WHAT ABOUT APPLES BEREKIT. WHAT ABOUT APPLES"), but Berekit was won over by the promise of coffee. Quacksalver demonstrated his wares by extending his arms to rubber-band length.

The innkeeper's broom snapped — the second this month. Berekit connected the dots: the village's accelerating decay started about two weeks ago, coinciding with **N'ith's release** from imprisonment. N'ith is described as a sibling to the gods, the personification of magic and change, whose influence manifests as entropy and structural decay.

Month ends with Berekit casting Detect Magic to scan the area.

**Plot seeds:** N'ith's corruption spreading through the swamp and village. The oversized cockatrice (mutated by N'ith's influence?). Something with a disproportionately large head darting behind a building. The innkeeper's ashen skin. Quacksalver as new party member. Two weeks of accelerating decay matching N'ith's release timeline.

## Cross-Campaign Notes

**Ophelius Berrus** (C07) mentions his sons — connecting to Gervald & Damrock Berrus (DF lore). His pocket watch counts down ~9 years. The Korvosian Palace grandfather clock reads 4710 Rova 10th (Doomsday Funtime's current date).

**The Grey Flame** (C06 vision) — older than Pharasma, name hidden. Bashevis served Pharasma 80 years but was "saved by another." This flame is fading from white to grey to nothing.

**The Armada** (C06 vision) — hundreds of thousands of impossibly large starships in a void, with eldritch entities behind dark clouds. This is the endgame threat seeded into Kibwe.

**Bones's transmutation** (C09) — someone was turning a person into a slime mid-transit through an unstable portal. The white flame slime in Kibwe (C06) also involved a Pharasma-cleric dwarf trapped in slime form. Slime transmutation appears across multiple campaigns.

**N'ith's release** (C08) — causing entropy and decay in the swamp region. Timeline matches roughly two weeks before current events.

**Carnon's inherited memory** (C01) — deep Pharasmian liturgical knowledge from an aeonic source. Origin unknown but significant given the Pharasma connections across campaigns.
