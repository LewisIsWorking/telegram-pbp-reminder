## Week 9 (Feb 23–Mar 01)

### 📅 Sunday, Mar 01

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:00:49):
Necrila says "My father is an oracle.
His domains are death, undeath and vigil.
Someone close to Elias Tammerhawk has asked him to enact his third domain. To remain vigil and to watch over Elias Tammerhawk.
I am a manifestation of his will for that matter. I am his daughter. His weapon tasked to reach out Elias and to scout and evolve."
Necrila pauses for a few seconds
"The rest of the information is classified and only for Elias Tammerhawk...... I have no ill intentions to hurt anyone related to them or allied with them.
I wish to speak no more of this unless we are lone
Too many vitality creatures here
Their allegiances unknown to me" Mira can see that when Necrila speaks about Elias she tries to avoid using "he" or "she".

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:01:53):
Necrila flashes her endless rows of sharp teeth back

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:03:58):
Necrila simply states 
"I am a voidborn,
You are a vitality form.
We are not the same.
Our views of the worlds are different.
To me your views are alien so are mines to you."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:04:09):
Callie:
"I normally stick my nose in, it's good as long as you don't end up losing it."

Callie smiles, a little less stressed out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:04:52):
Callie:
"She'll make it up to me some other way.
She just doesn't know it yet."

Callie looks at Moonshine a bit mischievously.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:05:04):
Callie turns and freezes:

"Marlo!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:05:10):
Marlo has arrived.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:09:33):
Mira considers this.
Mira:
"You're right. 
We are not the same."

She picks up her book.

Mira:
"But the Sin Lords weren't the same as anything that came before them either. 
And they still found ways to reshape the world."

*@Nemesiux*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:09:52):
Mira:

"We have ran out of time. Marlo is here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:33:43):
Something changes.

You guys don't hear it. 

You all feel it.

The casino doesn't go quiet. 

It goes professional.

Dealers straighten. 

Staff stop mid-step. 

Callie's spine goes rigid.

The clockwork band plays on but somehow even the music sounds more careful.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:34:04):
A door opens on the upper balcony.
Two women step out first. Tall. Beautiful. Dressed in almost nothing. They move like bodyguards, not dancers.
Between them, a man.
Short. Shorter than you'd expect.

He descends the staircase slowly. He is in no rush. This is his house.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:35:09):
You see it before you hear it.
His left hand is not a hand.
It is clockwork. Brass and steel. Gears visible through gaps in the plating. Each finger articulated with tiny pistons.
It grips the bannister as he descends.
Tick.
Tick.
Tick.
The gears turn with every step.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:35:46):
He reaches the casino floor.
His eyes sweep the room. Taking inventory. Counting faces.
His gaze passes over Necrila. Over Mira. Over Gobu hiding near the vending machine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:37:23):
Marlo moves REALLY fast.

For a short older man, he blurs forward, stopping right in front of you all.

You hear a whirring of gears coming from him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:37:40):
Then his eyes move to Beltias Kreun. In chains. On his casino floor.
Marlo smiles.
It is not a warm smile.
Marlo:
"Well, well, well.
This is quite something."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:37:43):
@RyoYamakawa @CapriciousC @Nemesiux @Aiden101 @LuNneS_B @Lokanadya

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:39:50):
Feel free to use this chat if you want to do something not in the same room / same moment as the main group.

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 01:41:33):
Necrila simply does the bow he did for Mira to Marlo and then awaits for the permission to speak

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:42:48):
Marlo looks at Necrila:
"Some sort of undead minion...?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:43:05):
Marlo's eyes glow very slightly as he looks at Necrila.

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 01:43:44):
Necrila simply shakes her head

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:46:11):
Marlo:
"Please speak up. If you can speak...?"

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 01:51:21):
"Thank you allowing me to speak. I am not an "undead minion" I am a void shell named Necrila. A pleasure to make you an acquittance. 
How may I address you?
I was adviced by Mad Rat on how to behave around you, but his instructions were too confusing."
Marlo can see that Necrila is kind of a slow creature like a newborn that is still trying to understand the world

**Capricious** (2026-03-01 01:53:31):
“Is that— Is that good? Why yikes? ‘Yikes’ sounds bad~”

Moonshine mumbles in response to Callie through her delirious mix of alcohol and stimulants before crashing and slumping face down into the table with a *KLUNK*. She perks back up at Marlon’s approach, completely missing the words exchanged about her, leaning toward Rax with an affirming nod and a breathy whisper that’s not nearly quiet enough with.

“New Bossman very strong o sumn. Many people listen. Lord Marlõ, I think. Be careful.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:35:32):
Marlo looks at Mad Rat, then back at Necrila:
"I see.
I don't think I'm that scary."

Marlo has a bit of a smile.

Marlo:
"And besides... you have brought me a great gift."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:36:22):
Marlo kicks the legs of Krune from under him and leans down into his face and says:
"... and what a lovely gift he is."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:36:43):
https://t.me/Path_Wars/66154/134685
Marlo turns from Krune at these comments.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:41:13):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 07:55:40):
There was a twitch in his eyes when Lenma said his name incorrectly.

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 09:33:38):
Rax had a similar eye twitch when he heard the mispronunciation from the inebriated cat. Without a word he moves in closer to her, taps her nose and actually whispers into her ear:

"Be quiet unless you like causing Callie trouble."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 09:57:04):
Marlo looks at you Rax.

**Capricious** (2026-03-01 09:58:18):
Moonshine reciprocates Marlo’s laugh, her shoulders visibly relaxing at the crime lord’s words at face value. Missing the eye twitch, the catfolk tilts her head with confusion as she ‘whispers’ back to Rax.

“Whaddya mean? I don’t want trouble. But Marlon’s so easygoing and kind~ He said it himself!”
