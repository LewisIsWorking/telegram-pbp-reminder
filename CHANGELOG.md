## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-26

### Summary
First versioned release. Consolidates all prior refactoring work (sessions 1–4)
plus today's new features into a stable, tested baseline.

### Added — New Features
- **/campaign command**: Type `/campaign` in any PBP topic to get a full scoreboard:
  campaign age, party size, weekly pace with trend arrows, complete roster with
  per-player stats (total posts, sessions, weekly count, average gap, last post),
  at-risk player warnings, and active combat state. This replaces the need to wait
  for scheduled roster/pace reports — players can check on demand.
- **/status command**: Quick health snapshot — party size, last post time, posts
  this week, at-risk players, combat state.
- **/help command**: Lists all bot features and GM commands in-chat.
- **Per-campaign feature toggles**: Add `"disabled_features": ["potw", "recruitment"]`
  to any campaign in config to turn off specific features per campaign. Valid toggles:
  alerts, warnings, roster, potw, pace, recruitment, combat, anniversary.
- **Config validation on startup**: Bot checks config structure before running —
  catches bad group_id, duplicate topic IDs, unknown feature names, malformed dates.
  Errors prevent the run; warnings are logged but continue.
- **Archive dashboard** (docs/index.html): Interactive web dashboard for
  weekly_archive.json. Line charts for posts per week, GM vs player splits, response
  gap trends, and a sortable campaign comparison table. Dark RPG-themed design.
  Works on GitHub Pages or locally.
- **Changelog notifications**: Bot posts release notes to the Foundry & GitHub
  topic automatically after each push.
- **Versioning**: Semver-based VERSION file and CHANGELOG.md.

### Added — Code Quality
- **87 tests** (32 helpers, 55 checker) covering: message parsing, combat state
  machine, boon selection/expiry, player warnings and removal, leaderboard stats,
  anniversary detection, recruitment checks, feature toggles, config validation,
  pace calculations, roster formatting, and all helper utilities.
- **CI test gate**: Tests run before the checker in GitHub Actions. If tests fail,
  the checker doesn't execute.
- **Extracted `_parse_message`**: Message validation and field extraction pulled out
  of `process_updates`, reducing the main loop from 111 to 75 lines.
- **Extracted `pace_split` helper**: Deduplicated GM/player weekly post split logic
  used by both `/campaign` and pace reports.
- **Shared timestamps**: All 11 per-run features now receive identical `now` and
  `maps` objects, eliminating 13 redundant `datetime.now()` calls per run.

### Removed
- `pbp_summary_feature.py`: Unused 206-line AI summary prototype. The `/campaign`
  command now fills this role without requiring an API key.

### Architecture (for reference — pre-v1.0.0 refactoring)
The codebase was restructured across 4 sessions from a single 1,200-line file into:
- `checker.py` (1,468 lines, 27 functions): All bot features and orchestration.
- `helpers.py` (418 lines, 28 functions): Pure utilities, constants, config loading.
- `telegram.py` (105 lines, 7 functions): Telegram Bot API wrapper.
- `state.py` (103 lines, 3 functions): Gist-backed state persistence.
- `test_helpers.py` (314 lines, 32 tests): Helper function test suite.
- `test_checker.py` (1,069 lines, 55 tests): Checker integration and unit tests.
- `docs/index.html` (411 lines): Archive dashboard.

Every function has docstrings and return type hints. Max nesting: 4 levels.
All settings are configurable via `config.json` with sensible defaults.
